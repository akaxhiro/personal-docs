[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[1][2][3]

  Since Renius asked me what I would expect from his side,
  I told him that he should take over my and Ben's working code,
  and lead the task as a main developer. He agreed.

[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

  I think I finished debugging, at least, for prototyp/demo purpose,
  and now the BE code is up and running on a guest domain (not domO)
  as a virtio block device server.
  I confirmed that FE on another guest domain, which is also a Zephyr app
  that I developed, successfully reads/writes a virtual disk emulated by BE.

  The last piece of code that I have to have implemented was
  xenforeignmemory_map() API which enables a guest vm to map foreign guest's
  (i.e. FE app) portion of memory (a ring buffer as well as data itself)
  onto its own address space.
  Since Zephyr has no vm (virtual memory in this context :) mapping,
  I added a make-shift mechanism to extend the memory space for kind of
  "device(peripheral)" memories on unused higher addresses.
  So growing only, no reclaiming (unmapping), no re-using spaces.

  (I also found a couple of bugs in my FE code.)

- I've been contacted by Rob Woolley (WindRiver).
  He pointed to his repository where his initial work has been pushed.
  He would like to have a meeting with me and other Linaro folks for
  future collaboration.
