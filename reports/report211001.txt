[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1],[2]
  Alex told me that he was going to sort out a list of tasks for the next
  devel-cycle plan and he would also include this card in there so that
  we would see members' favor/preferences.

  He said that it would be good for us to demonstrate the prototyping work,
  but "demonstrate" means that the code must also be accessible for the public.
  So he suggested that I should prepare for estimating the required efforts
  to transform the source code into more license-permissive form.

  I had no time to think about the estimated time this week.
  (First, I will have to refresh my memory about my own code.)


- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  I have not followed the discussions well.

[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's device model) integration
  I posted a new version of RFC[4] to re-ignite the discussion
  as Ilias suggested me.

  In my previous RFC[5], many UEFI components were handled as udevices
  (devices in U-Boot device model). They included
    - UEFI objects referred to by handles, including block devices
    - loaded images
    - protocol interfaces
  Simon seemed to like the idea at that time, while Heinrich thought it was
  an overkill approach.

  So in [4], I only dealt with block devices (disks and partitions) only
  and focused on making the implementation in a better shape aligned with
  U-Boot's driver model, especially lifetime management (probe/remove).

  The code itself has been almost completed last week, but I had to
  spend more time than I expected in reworking/cleaning up the code
  for RFC submission this week.
