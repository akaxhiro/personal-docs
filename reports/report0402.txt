  Ulf closed this card.
  I think that he should have discussed with socionext's LT
  before taking any action on this card.

[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

When we want to apply the dom0less configuration to BE app,
there are a couple of technical issues.
One is xenstore dependency. BE need to access xenstore database
in order to fetch configuration information in initializing itself
as a IOREQ server.
The problem is that xenstore is currently implemented as a user
space application on linux(dom0). So the Zephyr cannot simply
start up for itself as the *first* domain in the system.
It must inevitably synchronize itself with linux domain's booting.

- Zephyr as dom0
In my efforts above, I also tried to run a Zephyr app (hello world)
as the *first* domain instead of linux. I confirmed that it successfully
ran if some tweaks on gic initialization code were applied.
(Accesses to some gic registers must be commented out. I don't know why.)

However it doesn't mean that Zephyr can work as dom0, or a *control* domain,
because it lacks any ability to create/start/stop additional guest domains.
Providing such a functionality requires us to port Xen libraries as well as
command tools, in particular, "xl" command, to Zephyr environment.

Apparently, it will be difficult to do so partly due to limited API's
available on Zephyr and partly due to license incompatibility
(GPL v2 vs Apache v2).

In addition, we need to have, at least, xenstore daemon and xenlog daemon
running (probably on dom0) as well in order to provide Xen's full set of
features.

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress

- IOREQ on Arm[5] by EPAM
  The patch has now been merged in the upstream.

- Zephyr on Xen[6]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress
