Orko
====
[ORKO-27] (Run performance benchmarks across testing matrix)
* This task has been put back into "in-progress" state as I've got
  a new GPU card, Radeon RX7600, this weekend.

* Anmar suggested Synquacer or AVA for possible test platforms,
  but I don't believe that Synquacer is a choice for GPU reference
  because it has a bug in 32-bit read operation on PCIe bus.
  (A bunch of nasty hacks, which are NOT upstreamable, will be required
  on a graphic driver.)
  I think that Anmar (and Alex) has agreed to me, saying
  "f you start with the x86 evaluation using your PC and the AMD GPU, that
  will buy us enough time to find a proper Arm board. I think it will be
  the ADLink AVA Developer Platform. I just need to figure out how to get
  one to you."

* With Radeon, I have some progress and problems.
  To make the GPU recognised and workable on my development machine,
  I had to use mesa's vulkan driver (RADV), not AMD's open source driver
  (AMDVLK) as the latter has lack of support for, at least, one specific
  vulkan API's extension feature, VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.
  (AMDVLK has never been tested with virtio-gpu, I guess.)
  Almost three days were consumed in vain before I finally found the root
  cause on this driver.

  Then I tried to run vkmark benchmark application on a guest VM and
  it terminated abnormally emitting error messages from qemu (host) like:
  ---
  vrend_create_surface: context error reported 3 "Xorg" Illegal resource 1032
  context 3 failed to dispatch CREATE_OBJECT: 22
  vrend_decode_ctx_submit_cmd: context error reported 3 "Xorg" Illegal command buffer 329729
  virgl_cmd_resource_map_blob: resource map error: Invalid argument
  virtio_gpu_virgl_process_cmd: ctrl 0x208, error 0x1203
  virtio_gpu_virgl_resource_unmap: resource already unmapped 1135
  ...
  ---

  I have no idea how this error came up.
  VREND_DEBUG enables detailed logging for virglrenderer library, but
  there is no useful information found there.
  I probably need to deep-dive into vulkan implementation on the host side.

* Collaboration with other activities in the community?
  No progress seen

* Nvidia's new graphic driver (535.54.3)
  I have not tried it as it has not appeared as an Ubuntu package yet.

* Other issues with my v3 environment
  This was a result on my nvidia card with Collabora's v3 software.
  Now that I have AMD, we can throw them away unless I see the same
  errors again.

  (no progress)
  - "-display gtk" doesn't work
    (This happens with v4.)
  - [vertex] device-local=true: Failed with exception: Failed to perform atomic commit: Invalid argument
  - vkmark: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so: \
            undefined symbol: wlEglCreateSurfaceExport

[ETC]
* I asked Alex to think of giving me other tasks in Orko that I can help
  as I have been idle for a while (and will be in near future).
  No feedback yet.

* pcivirtio-gpu error on crosvm with vritio-gpu enabled
  I have not tried to reproduce the issue on Radeon yet.


SCMI
====
[SCMI-46] (improve scmi suport on U-Boot)
* No sure who will be responsible for reviewing my patches[1],[2]
  as there is no dedicated maintainer for SCMI-related patch.
  With no review comments, they are up in the air right now.

[1] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2023-June/519976.html
[2] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2023-June/520083.html

[SCMI-74) (Upstream patch of scmi base protocol support)
* After preparation, I submitted the first patch[3].
  - clean-up (checkpatch and correcting spells)
  - add/revise commit messages
  - add function/struct descriptions to *every* function/struct
  - add a test against the command, scmi
  - add man-page of scmi command
    (although the command is for debug purpose.)

  While I was afraid no one might want to review it as there is
  no practical benefit, Simon gave me some comments.
