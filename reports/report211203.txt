=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* assigned to me now
  Before thinking of any possible network configuration, I'm trying to
  survey measurement tools for network latency(/throughput),
  not only
    - ping/iperf/netperf
      (all of them can report some sort of 'latency'.)
  but also
    - socket timestamp feature[1]
      by which, timestamp will be added as part of control messages
      either on tx or rx to/from the media/kernel stack so that we
      can figure out the overhead of kernel stack.
    - Intel's AF_PACKET & AF_XDP socket-based application
      in "IOTG TSN Reference Software for Linux"[2]
    - Maxim's OPCUA TSN evaluation[3] 

Some code in [2] and [3] depend on OPC UA library, though.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* assigned to me now
  I don't understand what this card means yet.

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* sub-task of STR-68?
  Not started yet.

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio implementation
  no updates

* Continued to learn about Argo interfaces and virtio over Argo.
  Got a reply for Christopher.

* I'm also trying to compile argo modules and run a sample vsock app.
  Now I noticed that I had to enable CONFIG_ARGO on Xen explicitly.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[4]
  I postponed the submission RFC v2 as I want to see Heinrich's
  feedback first.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v7[5]
  I postponed the submission v8 as I want to see Heinrich's
  feedback first.
   
(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[6].
  No progress
  This task somehow depends on the issue below.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[7]
  Waiting for Heinrich's comments.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v7: submitted on 11/16
    uboot/uefi removable rfc: submitted on 11/09
    uboot/disk_integ rfc: submitted on 10/01

=== Issues ===
* I need boards (MachiatoBin) for network measurements.
  I prefer to have two for an isolated master-slave environment.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Dec 28 - Jan 5: off for New Year (maybe)
