Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).
  For example, a SR-IOV setup article from Intel guy[1].

* investigated MachiatoBin hardware/software specs for setup.
  The homepages [2][3] are not very much useful.

[2] https://www.solid-run.com/arm-servers-networking-platforms/macchiatobin/#overview
[3] http://macchiatobin.net/

* attended "automotive demo" discussion
  I found an interesting article[4] on "AVB(~= TSN) on Linux" for
  audio/video application.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* Alex gave me more info about the specific issue.
  I suspect that it won't take much time to fix it.

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress; Vincent told me that a main issue would be a missing support
  for trampoline code (long-distance jump).

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  no progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration
  I submitted RFC v2[5] as I confirmed that Heinrich agreed that
  we wouldn't have partition-table devices for now.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v7[6]
  I pinged Heinrich a week ago and have received no comments. Sigh.  

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[7].
  No progress
  This task somehow depends on the issue below.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[8]
  I'm currently proposing a different notation of device path like:
    /VenHw(e61d73b9-a384-4acc-aeab-82e828f3628b)/
      USB(0xf3,0x0)/USB(0x0,0x0)/USB(0x2,0x0)/HD(1,MBR,0x00000000,0x0,0x99800)
  to represent an *unambiguous/unique* combination of bus/port numbers.

  Got some comments from Heinrich and Mark.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/disk_integ rfc2: submitted on 12/10
    uboot/cap auth v7: submitted on 11/16
    uboot/uefi removable rfc: submitted on 11/09

=== Issues ===
* I need boards (MachiatoBin) for network measurements.
  I prefer to have two for an isolated master-slave environment.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Dec 28 - Jan 5: off for New Year (maybe)
Jan 10: Coming-of-Age Day (public holiday)
