[STR-73] (Setup for passthrough NIC)
* no progress
* TODO: create sub cards for SR-IOV/TSN trial

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* To measure a one-way trip time in an accurate way, I'm attempting to set up PTP
  (Precision Time Protocol) on MACCHIATOBin as its NIC interface supports
  IEEE-1588.

  After installing linuxptp package, I was able to successfully start
  ptp daemons both on a master and a slave with
    # ptp4l -i enp0s0 -A -2 (-s) -m --transportSpecific=1

  What is strange, however, is that I initially specified configuration files,
  automotive-master.cfg and automotive-slave.cfg, which are included in linuxptp
  source tree and the clock synchronization didn't work very well.
  Actually, it did work in a poor way, I mean, the gap between the master
  clock and slave clock was initially quite huge and was been adjusted
  by one second per 'step clock' adjustment.
  So synchronization will be expected to take a huge amount of time.
  Probably, some of parameters in a configuration file are inappropricate.

* I'm not able to try TSN scenario until I will get a pcie nic card.
  So I started to learn VLAN/QoS and linux's tc (traffic control)/qdisc
  (queuing disciplines) so that I can make *tuning* on network configuration
  to improve the performance (latency) even without TSN support.

* Here I've got one question; Do we really need TSN-capable nic on
  a receiver side? Most technologies related to TSN are applied for
  sender side.

  My assumption for automotive application include two tasks (as I said
  last week):
      a. one task for streaming from a back-view camera (latency-conscious)
      b. another task for car navigation with massive map data (bulk net traffic)

  A producer of video stream for (a), I think, should have a dedicated processor
  with an ethernet (or can?) interface. On the other hand, safety system application
  might be run on a VM.
  So I would cast a small question about assuming that the both side are running
  with TSN interface.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* UEFI-DM intergration patch v5[1] was merged in v2022.07-rc1.

* The follow-up patch[2],[3] was also merged in v2022.07-rc1.

* But there were some reports that the patch breaks the backward compatibility.
  So I submitted the fix patch[4],[5] to address the issue.
  Heinrich also posted another fix patch for the other issue.

(MISC)
* a new version from Kojima-san on his bootmenu v5[6]
  It contains (part of) my removable media patch[7].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[8]
  No progress
