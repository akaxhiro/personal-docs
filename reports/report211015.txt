- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1],[2]

  I'm waiting for any feedback from Mike or Alex.

- In my spare time, I'm learning to how to write Rust library on
  Zephyr. Since there is no "standard" library available, we will have to
  have wrappers (or language bindings) either Rust -> C(Zephyr APIs) or
  C -> Rust.

[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's device model) integration[3]
  I'm trying to address comments from Simon, one-by-one.
  Since there are quite a lot of comments, I'm afraid that I might
  miss out some of them.

  The main topic that we are now discussing is how partitions are
  *modelled* in U-Boot driver model. DM consists of class, driver
  and device and each device (or class) has its parent device.

  In the current U-Boot driver model, partitions don't have their own
  device class, but in my RFC, they are recognized as device objects.

  Simon suggested that a partition should have a *child* block device
  which is to be used to access data, while my RFC assumes that
  a partition is neither a block device nor has a child device, but yet
  exposes block io interfaces as a block device (a whole disk) does.

  What makes things even confusing is that we will have to handle
  "hardware" partitions as well as table-based (software) partitions.
  Different devices (MMC, NVMe and UFS) have different type of hw partitions
  and they are handled in different ways on U-Boot, in particular, MMC.
  (MMC hw partitions on a single device internally share one udevice.)

  There are a comment from Simon on reverting his "revert" commits.
  I hope that he now understands why it is needed.
