Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to study how we can do a breakdown of measured latency,
  particularly using a socket's timestamping (there exist HW timestamp and
  SW timestamp). Some application, pktlatency, from David's bpf sample[1]
  also makes use of this feature.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration
  I submitted v1[2].
  One comment from Heinrich; a problem in creating html documents
  from the source?

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp (capsule authentication)
  To fix a license issue, I adopted:
>  3) use another crypto library like gnutls

  Then, I submitted v10[3]. It was once pulled in Heinrich's repository,
  but was reverted due to a build error (on Windows and MacOS!).

(MISC)
* I will yet have to review some patches from Ilias on secure boot
  authentication algorithm.

* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress

=== Issues ===
* boards (MachiatoBin)
  I've got the delivery at the end of December, but the order
  was wrong; the package contained only one SingleShot board.
  I asked Shimada-san to re-order the boards. A new delivery
  date would be early February.
