Subject: [Weekly] Week ending 2021-08-20
Reply-To: 

[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Waiting for any comments on ML[2], but nothing after two weeks.

- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  I saw several comments and tried to reply to them one-by-one.

  A couple of interesting topics that I have not been aware of:
  1) Arm guy (Wei Chen) is also trying to build
     a hypervisor-agnostic BE (library?) based on kvm-tool[4].
     (I think that I and he have a similar solution in mind.)
  2) a proposal for kvm to add "MMIO/PIO dispatch" mechanism[5]
  3) Matias talks about his experience about his hypervisor-agnostic PoC
     (I don't know who he is.)

  There seem to be independent activities around the community.

- Investigated vhost-user implementation
  Especially, how the payload from FE driver is mapped and shared in
  BE's address space in advance, by which 'mmap'ing the data region
  can be skipped at every request handling on BE.

  I don't think that the approach here in qemu/kvm is quite
  kvm specific partly because kvm is a type2 hypervisor and
  partyly because the implementation highly relies on linux/vm
  (not virtual machine, but virtual memory) capabilities.

- I'm still trying to contact some engineers:
  no progress

  Intel: who has proposed msi-x support for virtio-mmio at linux kernel
  a year ago, aiming to improve the performance under multiple virt queues.
  Another Intel guy: who implemented ivshmem driver on Zephyr. I'm asking
  about their future plan, especially virtio implementation on top of it.
  Siemens: keep discussions with Jan
  Qualcomm: I'm asking for any comments on my proposal

- Stratos internal review
  What's this?
  When I proposed Mike that we should have a *regular* internal
  meeting to share the status/goal, he declined it. So now?

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* mkeficapsule v2[6]
  Since Ilias seems to be on vacation this week, there is no progress
  on the discussion about where to save a public key in capsule
  authentication.

- U-Boot UEFI
* tried to identify the cause of the problem[7]
  This is fundamentally the same problem that I have been working
  to address; The EFI subsystem recognises/identifies all the block
  devices only once at the initialization. So the system has no way
  to detect a device being added or removed at later time.

  I see it as a "removable media"-related issue, but the problem
  also happens when probing devices, say "scsi rescan", takes place
  more than once.

  Let's assume that we've done "probing" and then executed UEFI
  initialization with some U-Boot UEFI command. Then, at the second
  "probing", all the existing "blk_desc" structures, which are
  internal device-model objects of block devices, will be destroyed
  and re-created.
  But UEFI still holds/maintains the binding between a UEFI block device
  (block io protocol) and an *old* blk_desc structure.
  So succeeding read/write operations will lead to the system hang.

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[8]
  No discussions seen in ML

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
I will take one-week vacation at the beginning of September
(the week of Aug 30th or Sept 6th) unless the period of the state
of emergency in Tokyo will be extended after end of August.

But it is quite likely thanks to recent surge of covid cases.
