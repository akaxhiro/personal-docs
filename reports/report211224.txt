Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).

  In particular, various type of network configurations on kvm/qemu
  - I struggled a bit to set up a bridge which is to connect
    a vm's network interface to the host's local network.
    I haven't succeeded yet to enable a vm to reach a DHCP server
    (actually, a router) in the network to which my PC is attached.
    (If I launch a DHCP server on my PC's nic locally,
    everything works fine though.)

  - I can't try a PCI passthrough (vfio-pci) since my PC doesn't have
    an iommu. Maybe I'm going to try "nested" virtualization if
    I won't get a MacchiatoBin soon.

  - I found that Arnd implemented a macvtap interface more than ten
    years ago, but I didn't find any document which describes how
    a macvtap will be set up with kvm. (It seems to be easy if we use
    a vmm like libvirt/virsh, but I want to configure the system
    using standard host tools directly for better understandings.)

  - I'm going to learn how we can set up OVS (Open vSwitch) with kvm.

* continued to investigate the kernel's timestamping[1] on socket interface.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  no progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration, RFCv2[2]
  no progress; No comments from Heinrich

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v8[3]
  I submitted a new version with a very minor update.
  Although I haven't got any comments from Heinrich on the previous version
  (in more than one month), I had no choice other than doing so to push
  this patch toward the upstream.

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
  No progress
  This task somehow depends on the issue below.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
