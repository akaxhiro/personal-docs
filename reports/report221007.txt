  Leo suggested XDP case might be affected by the kernel configuration,
  CONFIG_BPF_JIT_xxx. I have not confirmed it yet.

  TODO: investigate eBPF case

  TODO: find out a generic configuration of bridge to fix multicast issue
  (although this won't have any impact on measured results).

  TODO: With my own benchmark program, I sometimes see that read/readmsg()
  after select() fails.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* datasheet of i225
  I confirmed that our company (socionext) has already signed up with Intel
  regarding CNDA (Corporate NDA), then I finally got a "premier account"
  to access documents in Intel Support Center.
  Now I have the datasheet in hand, while it doesn't contain any description
  about Qbv-related features, there are a couple of TSN documents found:

  a. I225/226 Time-Sensitive Networking, Software User Manual
  b. Ethernet Time-Sensitive Networking on Linux for Intel Processors &
     Ethernet Controller I225, Getting Started Guide
  c. Time Sensitive Networking FAQs

  (a) contains register-level descriptions to supplement the datasheet.
  Please note that all materials are marked as "Intel Confidential" and so
  any information that I've got from them cannot be disclosed even within
  Linaro.

  One thing, however, that I should mention here is that i225 seems to
  support "full offload" of taprio (Qbv) since (b) demonstrates an example
  command line of tc for "taprio" which has "flags 0x2", that is, full offload.

* In the discussion with Alex, he raised a concern against "lost packets"
  in my experiment. So I tried to identify the problem.
     sendmsg() returned ENOBUFS.
       packet_sendmsg() -> packet_snd() -> vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit()
                -> dev_queue_xmit() -> __dev_xmit_skb() -> dev_qdisc_enqueue()
                -> etf_enqueue_timesortedlist() failed

  Now that I know qdisc(etf) is a problem (I didn't dig into more details),
  I removed etf from my current configuration and attempted the measurement.
  Then no "lost packets" were reported, and the latency was much improved:

  With UDP_STREAM,
                         min    avg    max    stddev
  tap+bridge
     no netperf          47.1    62.6  116.5    6.4
     w 3 netperf's       97.1   124.3  698.1   25.6

  With TCP_STREAM,
     w 3 netperf's      100.3   145.7  270.9   30.3

  I don't know what is the factor that helps shorten the latency yet.

  In addition, it is a bit strange that the latency is also improved
  in TCP_STREAM case while we still see bunch of interrupts take place at
  the queue (TxRx-2) where packets from benchmark app are exclusively handled.
                IRQs      cpu#0   cpu#1   cpu#2   cpu#3
                TxRx-0:  293726       0       0       0
                TxRx-1:  316332       0       0       0
                TxRx-2:       0       0  374340       0 <=
                TxRx-3:      35       0       0       0

* I'm now trying to test "taprio(full offload)", but I don't observe
  consistent improvement so far.
  (Please note that taprio has a number of tuning parameters to try.)

  Vincent had a concern about using "mqprio" configuration since
  it is not part of TSN technology and it might confuse people.
  (My setup with mqprio depends on NIC's default priority scheme
  among tx queues.)

* TODO: I don't know yet how we can remove arch-timer interrupts.
   NO_HZ?, but the benchmark program calls select/poll() to wait for
   incoming packets and so we will need a timer on guest VM.

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)
* I carefully re-read Andrea's white paper of SDV[3], in which he mentioned
  an issue on TSN in VM environment. I intend to start my blob article with
  referring to his document. What it says, quoting
  "Since the kernel has to go through a
  number of layers to deliver a packet to a userspace
  application, this slowly adds up to ~70µs. We adopted
  the AF_XDP in-kernel fast path, which can deliver
  packets to user space directly by-passing the slower
  kernel layers. Although we didn’t meet the strict 1us
  timing, we demonstrated we could deliver packets up to
  the OPC-UA software layers in user space within ~4µs."

  What do those numbers mean?
  So I asked Ilias and Maxmim to clarify their experiment.
  I will have to carefully draft the text so that they are unintentionally
  compared with *my* numbers.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[4]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Heinrich wants to rework EFI block device implementation for better(?)
  DM-UEFI integration.
  Strangely, he doesn't include me in Cc for a series of his patches.
* I made comments on Sughosh's multibank update patch v11.
* I made comments on Jassi's developerbox FWU support patch v2.
* I made comments on Ilias' installMultiplePprotocol cleanup patch (RFC).

  My comments seem to not be welcomed.

* Review of secure boot test spec
  TODO: Yet to review the updated test spec[5].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress
