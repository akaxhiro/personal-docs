[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  After the discussion with Mike, I submitted a review request
  to Stratos ML[2].
  Mike told me that we should decide if it is worth continuing
  my study in the next development cycle, indicating that, if no
  Linaro member company show their interests in my approach, the task
  must be cancelled.
  Although it's not the way how I want to move things forward,
  I had no choice but bringing up my doc to ML immediately.

  I have a few ideas about improving the concept of virtio-proxy,
  including
    * device discovery (or configuration) for backend
    * triggering an interrupt via MMIO
    * support for statically shared memory of virt queues
      (like ivshmem and/or fat virtqueue?)
  But I won't update the doc until we have some sort of conclusion on ML.

- I'm still trying to contact some engineers:
  Intel: who has proposed msi-x support for virtio-mmio at linux kernel
  a year ago, aiming to improve the performance under multiple virt queues.
  Another Intel guy: who implemented ivshmem driver on Zephyr. I'm asking
  about their future plan, especially virtio implementation on top of it.
  Siemens: keep discussions with Jan
  Qualcomm: I'm asking for any comments on my proposal

  No reply from anyone this week, though.

- keep investigating ivshmem specification and implementation
  My focus' are
  * some feature/techniques in ivshmem might be brought into my proposal
    to shape up virtio-proxy approach
  * how virtio backend can be implemented with ivshmem
  * how easy/difficult it is to implement ivshmem on other hypervisors

- Alex started a general discussion about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].

- I asked Alex to have 1:1 meeting with me on regular base.
  No reply yet.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* mkeficapsule v2[4]
  I modified the patch after Heinrich's comments.
  It's ready to submit, but there is still an outstanding discussion
  about how/where a public key should be stored.
  I will hold off the submission until we've reached the agreement
  since test programs (pytest) can be affected by the result of discussion.

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[5]
  It seems to me that Jason misunderstands Ulf's intension.
  I think that Ulf should explain more about what kind of
  changes he expects with a good example.
