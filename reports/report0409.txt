- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

- Did some cleanup work just in case that someone inside Linaro
  may want to take a look at my code of BE app.
  (There are still bunch of hacky code though.)

- Started to examine *my* code, particularly usages of Xen
interfaces in the device initialisation. The purpose is to study
the possibility of isolating Xen-specific code from the rest of
generic code by defining some sort of shim layer or moving some of
Xen-specific initialisation steps from BE itself to Xen toolstack
(that is "xl" command) or Xen itself (IOREQ framework).

- discussion on Xen side
I raised those issues below and started some discussion with Stefano
(and others):
  1) xenstore dependency
  2) gic issue (but it was caused by my wrong configuration.)
  3) license terms of Xen libraries/toolstack

Regarding (3), I saw positive comments from other folks and it will
hopefully be discussed in Xen community, quoting
"Both of these are probably something we should discuss at the next
community call; and almost certainly something that would be good
for a XenSummit talk or design session."

It will be beyond my ability to follow (and certainly lead) the discussion :)
