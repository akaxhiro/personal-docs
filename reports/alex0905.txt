- my approach
  - your concerns:
    bootstrap of virtio-proxy channel
    performance
  - what can I do now for next step?
- other approaches, like
    (IOREQ/my approach)
    vhost-user
    ivshmem
    Argo
  - shared memory based solution
    vulnerable due to lack of isolation?
  - common hypervisor APIs are doable/feasible?
  - FD interface
    is it suitable for bare-metal/RTOS environment?
- goal/assumption of hypervisor-agnosticism
  - "single binary" vs. switching libraries at compile time
  - transport dependencies:
    virtio-mmio, virtio-pci
    shared-memory based vs. non-shared-memory based (Argo)
- next-cycle plan
  - how will you collect feedbacks from members?
  - no more PoR?
  - demo?
- Stratos internal review
