Subject: [Weekly] Week ending 2022-02-10
Reply-To: 

We have snowfall in Tokyo today.

Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to study how we can do a breakdown of measured latency,
  particularly using a socket's timestamping (there exist HW timestamp and
  SW timestamp).
  No progress due to U-Boot related tasks below.

  I'm going to get back to Stratos tasks next week as I will get
  MACCHIATObin boards in next two weeks.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration
  I submitted v2[2].
  In v1, I found a potential problem particularly when we use
  file-based variable storage (default configuration). Non-volatile
  variables are not restored from EFI system partition during
  the boot time.
  This issue was uncovered by capsule pytest failure during Azure CI.
  I have fixed it by breaking EFI subsystem initialization into
  two stages. Otherwise, the code should work well.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp (capsule authentication)
  v10 has faced build errors on Windows and MacOS in Azure CI.
  (In U-Boot CI loop, only host tools are tested for compiling
  on Windows/MSYS2 and MacOS/brew.)

  I submitted v11[3] after modifying a azure setup file to install
  necessary packages on both OSs.

(MISC)
* reviewed some patches
  - Ilias' bugfix on secure boot authentication algorithm
  - Sughosh's "FWU Multi Bbank update" v4.

* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
