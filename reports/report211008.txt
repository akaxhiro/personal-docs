- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1],[2]

  I made full efforts to estimate *remaining* efforts to complete
  virtio-proxy idea. The consequence is that I will need 20-22 weeks
  to re-write my prototype from the scratch.

  Please note that it contains some uncertain technical factors, including
  re-writing Xen libraries, which may be unnecessary, and modifying
  Xen's APIs which may depend on security model.
