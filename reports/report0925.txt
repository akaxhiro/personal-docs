[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v6[2]
  No new comments on ML.
  (I guess that Tom had no enough time at the end of the current
  release cycle.)

  I have missed out a bug report that Heinrich sent me two weeks ago.
  The problem is that secure boot tests start to fail after applying
  my capsule patch.

  The reason is that EFI initialization code is called early at
  the boot time if CONFIG_EFI_CAPSULE_ON_DISK_EARLY is enabled.
  So even if a new (block) device is attached (or plugged in) for test uses,
  it will not be recognized as a UEFI object.

  This issue has been long outstanding in EFI initialization and
  may not be a "big" problem for statically configured devices. However,
  once we want to use USB devices or CD-ROMs, it will emerge again.

- capsule authentication[3]
  I had a small talk with Sughosh (and Heinrich) about how to implement
  that feature and suggested that the existing "FIT signature verification"
  could be utilized so that we would not reinvent the wheel.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  Continued to work on v4, in particular, sdhci controller side.

  I'm still anticipating the feedback from Adrain on my comments/questions,
  but have not seen any reply for more than a week. 

  As I want to take a step-by-step approach by confirming one change
  at a time in ML, the current situation will slow me down for a while.

- I've got some feedback from Ben about his current status.
  Yet I don't understand how busy he is and how much effort
  will be needed for the new v4 version.

[LBI-40]
- I had a sync-up meeting with Alex and Mike.
  He gave me the technical explanation on the project.
  I will (probably) join bi-weekly meetings.
