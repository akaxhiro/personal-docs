Summary:
Linux software engineer with 15+ years of experiences in a semiconductor
company after working on various OS-related research works in
a computer company. Last 10 years dedicated in contributing to
the development of OSS, linux kernel and firmware.

Seek for a new challenging job where I can leverage my experiences
in Linux kernel and related software in order to continue
to contribute to OSS as well as to foster my own skill in emerging
technology areas, among others, interested in virtualization,
security or adaptation of new cpu architecture like Risc-V. 

If possible, find a position who is allowed to work from home
remotely (Japan). Otherwise think of moving near to on-site
office.
