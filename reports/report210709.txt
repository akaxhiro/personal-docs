All the venues in Tokyo and neighbourhood are not allowed
to accept any spectators for Olympic games. So the ticket
I hold will also eventually be cancelled.

[STR-7]/[STR-21]
- started studying other hypervisors in order to understand
ã€€how virtio devices are implemented on them.

  Jailhouse: I found that I had misunderstood ivshmem in some way
  as it is yet another transport, like pci or mmio. It is not
  a right thing that we would implement virtio-proxy "for virtio-mmio"
  on top of ivshmem. If I understand correctly, ivshmem can
  potentially provide a kind of hypervisor-agnostic solution for backend
  as it appears as a PCI device on both frontend and backend alike.

  Gunyah: No virtio implement yet? It supports "para-virtualized"
  devices, using "vdevice" mechanism. It looks similar to Xen's
  IOREQ (maybe).

- keep learning Rust by myself[1].
  Consumed another 20 videos this week.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* signing feature to mkeficapsule[2]
  no progress

- There is one interesting topic in U-Boot[3], which will hopefully
  lead to more graceful integration of UEFI to U-Boot's device model.

=== Issues ===
* So a big question here is whether my approach can be applied/deployed
  to other hypervisors (to meet the goal of STR-7)?
  Who will be able to take care of it at this point?
