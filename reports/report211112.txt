Stratos
=======
[STR-66]
* Looked more into hypervisor-less virtio implementation and
  had some dialogue with Dan Milea (WindRiver).

 His implementation uses a draft feature of shared memory defined
 in virtio draft version 1.2 to eliminate the need of memory mapping
 hypervisor calls.
 This can apparently be applied to other approaches, including my virtio-proxy.

* Started to learn about Argo interfaces and Christopher's study
  on virtio over Argo.

  He seems to want to use dma api for bounce buffering, but Argo
  does not expose any shared memory region explicitly and this will
  add more overheads due to extra data copying than on other shared-memory
  based approach, like ivshmem (and fatvirtqueue?).

  Dmytro updated his current work on this card.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[1]
  I suggested that, even if we wanted to hold partition table data
  somewhere, we'd better have it within a block device structure,
  in particular, using a "tag" support which is also set to be added
  in my next version of RFC.
  It seems that Simon finally admitted this approach.
  Not sure yet what Heinrich thinks of that since he didn't comment.

  Anyhow, if we want to convert partition drivers to DM, it will
  require additional efforts of reworking the code.

[TS-102]
- Ilias assigned me to this card.
- mkeficapsule v6[2]
  While I'm proposing that we should have a tool-local header file
  to fix a build failure on OpenBSD, I haven't got any feedback
  from Heinrich and the re-work is suspended.

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager
  I posted a RFC[3].
  It is an RFC because I think that some people may not see it very
  useful as it is already supported in distro_bootcmd script.

  Unexpectedly, I got a few positive comments from Heinrich and another folk.
  A major issue is how we should represent a "removal media" as
  a device path, which may not be attached to the board when we define
  a "BOOTxxxx" variable.
