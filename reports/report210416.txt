[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
-Continued to investigate *my* code.
 The purpose is to study the possibility of isolating Xen-specific code
 from the rest of generic code.

 Last week, I said that I was thinking of two options
  1.to define some sort of shim layer (HAL, hypervisor abstraction layer), or
  2.to move some of Xen-specific initialisation steps from BE itself
    to
      a.Xen toolstack (that is "xl" command), or
      b.Xen itself (IOREQ framework).

  Under the current implementation of IOREQ API's, (2-a) is simply
  impossible because such interfaces, like create_ioreq_server(),
  are expected to be called by BE itself.
  (There is no function argument to specify the BE domain.)

  (2-b) may also be undesirable since it will make Xen even *fatter*
  and less flexible.

  I have come up with yet another variant of (2-a); moving Xen-
  specific code to dom0 as a "proxy (or delegate)" which is set
  to communicate with BE domain and interpret/pass on MMIO events
  from FE to BE as "request messages" as qemu/vhost-user does. 

  Even with this approach, however, we will have to call a small
  number of hypervisor- specific interfaces on BE, say, triggering
  an interrupt to FE as a notification of virtqueue update.
  (There is also another issue about the way of sharing virtqueues
  and data between FE and BE.)

- license terms of Xen libraries/toolstack
  Since I have not yet followed Xen community calls, I don't know
  what's being discussed there regarding this issue.

  Meanwhile, I noticed that some guy(s) from EPAM have also been
  working on "Zephyr on dom0." He asked me to show my current code,
  particularly event channel and xenstore drivers, to him.
  It is impossible for now.

[STR-4]?
- Continued to discuss SCMI demo on ML
  As I mentioned in Stratos ML, I'm still a bit skeptical about
  "single binary" approach.
