Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* No update on results in [1]
  [1] itself is getting rather obsolete due to these days' changes.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Still continued to investigate a big latency observed  in a long-run (currently
  15 minutes) measurement.

  I tried a couple of changes in settings.
  1) update the kernel to PREEMPT_RT v6.3-rc2
  2) fix CPU affinity of kvm process
  (3 try yet another gate list as Alex suggested last week)

  v6.3 contains a couple of patches against igc (NIC) driver around TSN-related code
  and I expected a small hope but ...

  Regarding (2), I found that I accidentally had changed the kernel command line
  against cpu *isolation* and it ended up to not isolating cpu#3 for kvm process
  in my tests I have reported last week.
  After fixing this error along with the kernel update, I performed the measurements
  once again.

  Apparently, as shown in [2] (page 75 and later), the result seem to be unaffected
  by those changes and known issues (big spikes and PTP disorder) were still observed.
  The average and the standard deviation of latency in non-netperf case were even
  increased. Not sure why.

  === 3/20/2023 ===
  NIC doesn't allow for interleaving of gate control, like #1 and #3 (and not #2 nor #4)
  simply because the registers can hold the *start* time and *end* time per queue.
  === ===

  For some reason, I still fail to set up XDP+AF_XDP case as in the past.

  === 3/20/2023 ===
  I mistakenly invoked kvm process with a wrong parameter.
  (I should specify "runqemu.sh ovs_afxdp" but actually did "runqemu.sh xdp_afxdp".

  After fixing the parameter, I was able to enable the network but I got a kernel panic
  (network watchdog relating to TX timeout in igc).
  This seems to be due to some patch against igc (NIC) driver introduced in v6.3.
  I have temporarily to revert it.
  That works, but then after the measurement, I got another kernel error message,
  which is set to be fixed by *that* patch.
  and the network went down.
  === ===

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[4]
* I spent most of my time in writing up an initial text for the next article.
  I basically finished to describe the test environment and system/network setup
  (how to configure the network with proper parameters).
  Another two or more days will be needed to describe the test result and analysis.

  See the unfinished draft [5].

* My proposal of TSN for Linaro Connect session was finally accepted.
  My plan is to create the slides based on the blog article *plus* additional analysis.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
No update


=== Patch status ===

=== Issues ===
* I still need a PCIE (intel x550 or 82576) card for SR-IOV testing.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Mar 21: Sprint Equinox Day (public holiday)
(Around this week, I may take a week-long vacation.)
