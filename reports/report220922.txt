We had a short week due to two public holidays.

Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* No update. See [1].

  - mqprio + etf
  - sample-app-taprio[2] with 3 instances of netperf

  PCIe NIC (i225) with kernel 5.18+

    macvtap               92.5  139.1  275.4   35.6
    tap                  107.4  228.8  434.4   70.4
    OVS                  212.6  344.0  612.8   66.3
    eBPF (XDP)          5598.0 6586.0 7659.0  390.3

  TODO: investigate eBPF case

  TODO: find out a generic configuration of bridge to fix multicast issue
  (although this won't have any impact on measured results).

  TODO: With my own benchmark program, I sometimes see that read/readmsg()
  after select() fails.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
===8<== (from last week's report)
  The time consumed on the receiver side can be split into 4 time spans:
  a) from interrupt arrival to invocation of interrupt handler
  b) from interrupt handler to wake-up of vhost process
  c) vhost processing to wake-up of kvm process
  d) from kvm wake-up to guest wake-up and packet reception by guest's driver 

As far as this trial is concerned, (a)+(b), (c) and (d) are running
on different processors.

  (usec)  w/o netperf    w/ 3 netperf's
  latency  71             150
  (a)      <= 20           <= 62
  (b)      19              25
  (c)      17              31
  (d)      <= 14           25

  NOTE:
  * Those are NOT mean values, but ones observed in a single packet handling.
  * (a) is not accurate because we don't know exactly when the packet arrived.

At a glance, (a)+(b) seems to contribute most to a gap between the two cases.
Based on the ftrace log, major disturbing factors in (a)+(b) are
  1) interrupt handling for netperf packets
  2) interrupt handling for arch timer
===>8===

* I continued to investigate the issue; interrupts are distributed across
  rx queues even under the packet filtering enabled at hardware level.

  Intel i225 has ability of enforcing packet filtering based on MAC address
  (source or destination), VLAN tag (priority) and so on.
  I tried many parameters with "ethtool --config-nfc", but nothing affects
  the results. It seems that no filtering is enabled.

  The only insight that I've got is that, if UDP_STREAM is used as netperf
  test, only one of queues are filled with packets. But the queue is not
  one that I try to assign network traffic to.

  FYI: Here are statistics of interrupt counts during execution of 3 netperf
  instances.
  - Using TCP_STEAM (used until now) at netperf,
    IRQs      cpu#0   cpu#1   cpu#2   cpu#3

    TxRx-2:       0       0      61       0     |
    TxRx-3:       0       0       0  312627   --+-- distributed

  - Using UDP_STREAM at netperf,
    IRQs      cpu#0   cpu#1   cpu#2   cpu#3
    TxRx-0:     334       0       0       0
    TxRx-1:       0      46       0       0
    TxRx-2:       0       0     116       0
    TxRx-3:       0       0       0  107185  -- I exected queue#0, not #3

TCP's ACK (from server to client) may have caused TX interrupts(?).
I also tried XPS (Transmit Packet Steering), but it doesn't improve
anything.
===

* Anyhow, now I believe that the best solution is that we should use
  NIC with VF's (SR-IOV enabled) so that all the interrupts are directly
  dispatched to VM guests. We will have no worry about disturbing interrupts
  that I'm looking at above.
  If I were a car maker, I would buy such an IP :)

* TODO: Search for the datasheet of Intel i225

* TODO: I don't know yet how we can remove arch-timer interrupts.
   NO_HZ?, but the benchmark program calls select/poll() to wait for
   incoming packets and so we will need a timer on guest VM.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[5]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Reviewed Sughosh's multibank-fw-update patch (v10) and made comments[6]
  I don't like the way how "ImageIndex" be treated in A/B update.
  I also had local chats with Sughosh, I hope that he now understands my point.

* Review of secure boot test spec
  TODO: Yet to review the updated test spec[7].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[8]
  No progress
