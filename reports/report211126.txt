* hypervisor-less virtio implementation
  Continued to talk with with David (RedHat) and Dan Milea (WindRiver).

  I'm not yet clear about what kind of data shared memory regions can hold.

* Continued to learn about Argo interfaces and virtio over Argo.
  I'm trying to contact Christopher, asking a few questions about
  his thoughts on how virtio-over-argo should be implemented.
  No reply so far.

  I see a couple of issues:
  1) Argo doesn't have device discovery protocols.
  2) How the access to configuration space be emulated.
  3) I'm afraid that there are no appropriate interfaces with which
     argo transport be seen transparent from higher virtio device protocols.
     I think that the best way to implement virtio-over-argo is to
     rewrite/replace virtqueue_add_sgs/add_outbuf().
     If so, I doubt that this is no longer a virtio implementation
     since we simply mimic the queue operations.

* I'm also trying to compile argo modules (xen-argo.ko and
  vsock_argo_transport.ko) for arm64 and a user library (libargo)
  so that I will write a simple test program.

  xen-argo.ko lacks arm64 support, in particular hypervisor call stub.
  vsock_argo_transport.ko uses old kernel interfaces (maybe).
  Looks easily fixable.

* I talked to Kojima-san about his efforts/experiences on implementing/
evaluating TSN on Developer Box in LEDGE project.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[1]
  I'm preparing RFC v2. 

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v7[2]
  I asked Heinrich to review main part of my patch series. No response.
  Ilias gave me ack's instead.
   
(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[3].
  No progress

* Heinrich reported that the logic of creating a device path for
  usb mas-storage was wrong as different disks on different port
  might have the same path.

  I proposed a workaround patch[4].
