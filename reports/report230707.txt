Orko
====
[ORKO-27] (Run performance benchmarks across testing matrix)
* Vkmark benchmark app doesn't work with Radeon.
  Since the last week's report, I saw little progress on the issue.
  In addition to the error below,
  ---
  vrend_create_surface: context error reported 3 "Xorg" Illegal resource 1032
  context 3 failed to dispatch CREATE_OBJECT: 22
  ---

  I observed another error, -EINVAL, in MapMemory call when I tried another
  vulkan application, vkcube, which is a much simpler one than vkmark.
  On the host side (virglrender/qemu), this call invokes mmap() syscall
  against a file descriptor (probably memfd) which was created somewhere before.

  Since there is no other clue for the potential root cause, I'm going to
  looking into a code related to this API next week.

* Collaboration with other activities in the community?
  AMD guy had a session[1] on virtio-gpu on Xen at Xen Summit.
  It seems that his work covered almost of all that we expect to do
  in this card and even more, except that the measurement is done on x86
  not on Arm.

* Nvidia's new graphic driver (535.54.3)
  I have not tried it as it has not appeared as an Ubuntu package yet.

* Get a test platform (AVA)
  No update from Anmar.

[ETC]
* I asked Alex to think of giving me other tasks in Orko that I can help
  as I have been idle for a while (and will be in near future).
  No feedback yet.

* pcivirtio-gpu error on crosvm with vritio-gpu enabled
  I have not tried to reproduce the issue on Radeon yet.


SCMI
====
[SCMI-46] (improve scmi suport on U-Boot)
* trivial bugfixes[2],[3]
  No progress in ML

[3] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2023-June/520083.html

[SCMI-74) (Upstream patch of scmi base protocol support)
* patch v1[3]
  I responded to Simon's comments, asking how the implementation
  can be aligned with U-Boot's driver model.
  No feedback yet.

  Otherwise, addressing most of the comments are trivial.

[3] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2023-June/521183.html

[SCMI-49] (Add pinctrl protocol support)
* Started.
  Implemented all the protocol interfaces. No tests done.
  As I said before, the hardest part in this task is API testing.
  I will consider reusing the existing pinctrl/gpio test code,
  or borrowing a portion of the code, on sandbox.

  The remaining work is to implement either DT-based
  pinctrl driver or gpio driver as U-Boot devices.
  They belong to SCMI-52. I have not decided yet which I
  start with, pinctrl or gpio (or both at the same time).


U-Boot support
==============
* Had a small discussion with Kojima-san regarding RAM_DISK_PROTOCOL
  implementation on UEFI. (He submitted the patch today.)
* Followed some guy's help request[4] on bootmenu.
* Followed some guy's help request[5] on secure boot & non-volatile
  variables.
