# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  No progress in ML.
  He said that the first priority for him was to merge Ilias'
  UEFI variable patch first.

  [2] runtime variable access via cache
      https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2019-June/371769.html
  [3] non-volatile variables support

# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- No updates on Bugzilla[4].
  I put this card in "blocked" state.

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic

- I put this card in "closed" state.

- Secure boot follow-up v2[5], pylint[6]
  I asked Heinrich about his view on this patch.
  He said that I should post a new version, but there was only one
  comment from him in ML (and also via his private email). I replied,
  saying "no" with detailed explanation.
  Since then, he has not made any comment/response.

  So, as is often the case with Heinrich, I can't guess
  what he is thinking now.

- "intermediate certificates" support v2[7]
  I asked Heinrich about his view on this patch.
  He said nothing.

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update
# No updates since last week.

- capsule update patch v2[8]
  I asked Heinrich about his view on this patch.
  He said nothing.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [9]

- rework[10] on Ben's code.
  1. add trivial changes (mis-spellings, checkpatch errors)
  2. convert sdhci-uhs2.c to a module
  3. split some patches to smaller ones for readability/maintainability
  4. now trying to fix memory allocation issue

- Continued to work on the issue (4) above.
  I gave Ben my experimental code and ask him to run and test it.
  It doesn't work as expected, I have no other way to debug than
  examining debug messages in a kernel syslog from Ben.

  Now that debugging on the hardware is a major blocking factor,
  my efforts must slow down from now on.

(Misc)
- I will have to think of writing a blog article about UEFI
secure boot.
