# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  No progress seen in ML.
  He said that the first priority for him was to merge Ilias'
  UEFI variable patch first.

# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot follow-up v2[5], pylint[6]
  no comments from Heinrich so far

- "intermediate certificates" support v2[7]
  no comments from Heinrich so far

  I've got a message in which a guy claimed that my code didn't
  support intermediate certificates. He seems not to be aware of
  my patch[7].
  Anyhow, this is the first *real* user that I have known.

# Header: U-Boot capsule update
# No updates since last week.

- capsule update patch v2[8]
  no comments from Heinrich so far
  a few comments from Sughosh. All are trivial.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [9]

- I started to rework[10] on Ben's code.
  1. add trivial changes (mis-spellings, checkpatch errors)
  2. convert sdhci-uhs2.c to a module
  3. split some patches to smaller ones for readability/maintainability
  4. now trying to fix memory allocation issue

- Ben also took part in running and testing my code
  at some point of this week.
  He seems to be cooperative, at least, in running the code
  on his platform. But I don't know if he is willing to debug
  the code.

  My one-week efforts have already saved 2-to-3 months for Ben
  as far as we trust his previous estimate.

  The current issue is (4). I have proposed several approaches
  to Ulf, but got no response.
  Unless I have good feedback from Ulf, I will hold off this task.
  Again, I don't intend to take over Ben, neither to take responsibility
  for this whole task.

(Misc)
- I will have to think of writing a blog article about UEFI
secure boot.
