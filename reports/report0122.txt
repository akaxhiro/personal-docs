- Trial of Xen guest vm

- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[2] (backend server) on zephyr.

     1.implement hypercall routines (based on linux, done)
     2.import 'event channel' and 'xenbus (or xenstore)' interfaces 
       (drivers) from mini-os/unikraft tree. (done)
     3.fix any compiling problems in Xen libraries
       (this may require additional code to be developed.)

  Done (1) and (2), adding a bunch of hacky code to minimise
  the necessary changes to the files imported from unikraft.
  They include
    * wrappers to convert unikraft's api's to Zephyer's, for example,
		#define uk_waitq_wait_event(wq, condition)      \
			while (1) {                             \
				k_sem_take(wq, K_FOREVER);      \
				if (condition)                  \
					break;                  \
			}
    * a function to dynamically add/map one 'page' of memory which is required
      to communicate with xenbus/xenstore
      This feature is quite unusual as Zephyr basically doesn't support
      any hot-plugging (either cpu, memory or devices) and all the pages in memory
      space are set to be P==V mapped at boot time.

  I'm going to tackle "linking" problems (3) next week. Some adjustment of interfaces
  between (2) and Xen user libraries will be needed.

- continued studying FF-A (Firmware Framework for Armv8-A) specification.

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress.

- IOREQ on Arm[3] by EPAM
  v4 is now under review in ML

- Zephyr on Xen[4]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

(Misc)
[U-Boot]
- Submitted trivial patches to fix coverity errors on capsule update code.[5]

      https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2021-January/438313.html

- U-Boot's regular video call started.
  I didn't attend the first meeting as it was held at 1:30am(!) in local time.

- Capsule update is now a requirement in EBBR according to Grant's e-mail.
