Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* No progress

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[1]
* Finished to draft the second blog article[2]
  I let Ebba know that the article is almost ready for post, but
  She is out of office until April 17.

* Started to create the presentation slides[3] for Linaro Connect Talk.
  It is based on the slides that I made for the meeting with Continental,
  and I want to add more slides for the analysis.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
* SCMI on U-Boot
  Vincent asked me if I wanted to work on SCMI implementation.
  Since I didn't know much about the current status, I looked into
  the code.
  Then I tried to create the prototype code for the Base protocol[4].
  It took only a few hours for me to complete 95% of coding.
  (Etienne insisted that he didn't see the need for Base protocol
  on the current U-Boot, though.)

  I don't think it requires more than half an hour whatever
  the protocol is as a SCMI driver on U-Boot (as a SCMI client) is merely
  a thin layer to call APIs to the undering SCMI agent (server).

  So I basically believe that, once somebody faces any demand for SCMI
  support (for any protocol), then he or she can implement it on top of
  the current implementation quite easily at that time.
  (My prototype code above is also based on 'clk_scmi' driver.)
  (If there is something missing, it may be virtio-scmi driver.)

  Less than 20% of my bandwidth would be enough even if I had to
  take on the task.
