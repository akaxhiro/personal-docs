[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Posted the patch v6[2].
  The changes were quite small and trivial.
  No feedback from DFU maintainer.

  Tom, the top (and default) maintainer of U-Boot, suggested that
  someone else should review the patches if Lukasz, the DFU maintainer,
  was busy. (He is actively commenting on the ML though.)
  Okay, but who can review them and say "OK"?

- Sughosh started the discussion about capsule authentication[3]
  I hoped he would post his next version soon, but not yet.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  I started to look at some comments, especially from Adrian,
  on sdhci specific code as those comments are related to "modularization"
  and rather trivial than those on generic side.
  Some comments, however, need the code to be re-factored and
  it would make it difficult for me to debug without any hardware.

- Pinged Ben for his current status, but saw no reply yet.

(Misc)
- Blog write-up on UEFI secure boot
  
  I think I have finished drafting the article[5] for review.
  How and whom can I ask to review it?
