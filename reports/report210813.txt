Subject: [Weekly] Week ending 2021-08-13
Reply-To: 

[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Waiting for any comments on ML, but nothing after one week.
  (I believe that Mike have contacted and asked Qualcomm/Google folks
  to review the proposal as he promised.)

- had 1:1 meeting with Alex
  The purpose is to share my current status and discuss technical issues
  with him, and in addition, to get informed about what's happening
  around Stratos project in Linaro.

  What I noticed in this meeting is that even Alex doesn't understand
  the details of my proposed specification as well as the goal of my study
  and the plan for prototyping (step 1,2 and 3 as I mentioned in a past
  weekly report) of virtio-proxy approach very well.
  If he doesn't, who else will want to understand and review my proposal?

  In addition, he suggested that we might be able to think of source-level
  portability instead of "single-binary" approach.
  But if we lift this restriction, I will have taken a totally different
  approach. That is why I insist, in ML, that we should first discuss
  the goals/requirements/use cases for "hypervisor-agnosticism".
  Otherwise (without any consensus on those assumptions), it won't be worth
  discussing specifically about my proposal!

- I'm still trying to contact some engineers:

  Intel: who has proposed msi-x support for virtio-mmio at linux kernel
  a year ago, aiming to improve the performance under multiple virt queues.
  Another Intel guy: who implemented ivshmem driver on Zephyr. I'm asking
  about their future plan, especially virtio implementation on top of it.
  Siemens: keep discussions with Jan
  Qualcomm: I'm asking for any comments on my proposal

  No reply from anyone this week.

- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  I made some comments to Stefano's reply.
  As Alex will stay on vacation until Sept 5th, we won't anticipate
  visible progress in discussions on this subject (and my proposal
  as well) for a while.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* mkeficapsule v2[4]
  I have no update since the discussion about where to save a public key
  is still going on (actually a bit stalled).

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[5]
  No discussions seen in ML

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v2: submitted on 07/27
    uboot/cap misc v2: merged
    kernel/uhs2  v3.1: submitted on 11/06

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
I will take one-week vacation at the beginning of September

in Tokyo will be extended after August.

But it is quite likely thanks to recent surge of covid cases.
