[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- Continued step-2 work
  I finished the coding, and confirmed that the code can compile.

- Among others, there may be, at least, three technical issues in step-3:
  * it is totally unknown that my approach, particularly virtio proxy
    protocol (RPC), is applicable to other hypervisors than Xen.
  * Some of Xen's IOREQ-related API's, so Xen itself, must be modified.
  * Open-AMP is used as virtio library on frontend side, while
    kvmtools-origin library is used on backend side in my prototype.
    This means that the two interface might conflict when
    the frontend code and the backend code are integrated in virtio
    proxy implementation which has both aspects.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* Add signing feature to mkeficapsule[1]
  no progress as I focused on virtio work this week.
