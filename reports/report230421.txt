[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* No progress

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[1]
* I'm trying to address the comments from Ebba[2].
  I'm not sure, though, that the blog will be published before the Connect.

* I finalised and uploaded my presentation slides to sched.com, but
  Continued to make efforts in improving the doc[3].

* Once again, I performed the tests for all the bridge types.
  Then, one more side was added to illustrate the variation in measured latencies.
  See the page 19 in [3].

[STR-7] (Create a common virtio library for use by programs implementing a backend)
* I have completely forgot it, but it was now closed by Alex.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* closed by Alex

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
