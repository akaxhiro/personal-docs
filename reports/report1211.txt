[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[3]
  Addressed more Adrian's comments.
  As we don't have any critical issues on 'host' side, I will put
  this task on hold until Ben will get back to the topic.
  Last week, he suggested that he would resume in a week,
  but I don't know what is his current status yet.

  After some debugging efforts, I confirmed that the code is up and
  running. The demo app is just to read a file and dump data, no fancy thing.

  While there are lots of room for improvement in the code, I'd like to
  think of the next step other than the frontend-side work.

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  The patch is ready, but I had no time to submit the patch this week.

- Zephyr on Xen[4]
  No progress, at least, on my side.

  One person (Nataliya, personal?) promoted herself to taking STR-11.

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress
