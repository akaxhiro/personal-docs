Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).

* I'm going to write down some document[1] to summarise my task here.

* XDP-based bridge
  I continued to examine the code in [2].
  The example code, l2fwd-demo.sh, gives us a good base of bridge
  implementation for my trial. Since the network configuration that
  the author assumed there is a bit complex, I made a small change
  to make a bridge function simpler.
  Added a few slides in [1]. 

  But I didn't and won't try the code on my PC because, as I said,
  I don't want to corrupt my system by accident (even if unlikely).
  I will postpone the trial until I will get a MACCHIATOBin board.

* measurement program
  Since [2] also has example codes for measuring network latencies,
  pktlatency and ovslatency, I will look into them, figuring out
  how the metrics are obtained. It seems that HW timestamp feature
  is utilised in the programs.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration, RFCv2[3]
  No progress

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v9[4]
  After I made some replies to Heinrich, I submitted v9
  (because I didn't expect to see more comments from him).

  One issue is how we should treat openssl library with U-Boot
  as the license at openssl may be seen to conflict with GPL(v2).

(MISC)
* Reviewed some patches from Sughosh and Masami which are
  for FWU Multi Bank Update (A/B update).

* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[5].
  No progress

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v9: submitted on 1/18
    uboot/disk_integ rfc2: submitted on 12/10
    uboot/uefi removable rfc: submitted on 11/09

=== Issues ===
* boards (MachiatoBin)
  I've got the delivery at the end of December, but the order
  was wrong; the package contained only one SingleShot board.
  I asked Shimada-san to re-order the boards. A new delivery
  date would be early February.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Feb 11: National Foundation Day (public holiday)
Feb 23: Emperor's Birthday (public holiday)
