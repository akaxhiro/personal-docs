[KWG-473]
# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  I haven't seen any new comments in ML.

  [1] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2020-March/404441.html
  [2] runtime variable access via cache
      https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2019-June/371769.html
  [3] non-volatile variables support
      https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2019-September/382835.html

[KWG-471]
# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- No updates on Bugzilla[4].
  No response.

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- RSA extension[5]
- Secure boot
  I posted v7[6] with [7], and now it's been pulled in v2020.07-rc.

  *But* Sughosh reported that the verification logic in my patch
  was wrong. While I'm still investigating the issue, I will have
  to change the implementation.

  The impact is still unknown, but in the worst case, we will miss
  v2020.07 again. I reported the issue in ML[8].

[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- RFC patch[9]
  Continued updating the code to prepare for v1.
  (I decided to drop 'variable update' capsule support from this
  patch series.)

  It's been almost done, but due to the issue above[8], I will have to
  suspend the task for a while.

- Discussions about runtime variable access support in Boot-arch ML[10]
  Little progress on ML

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [11]

- I talked to Ben (the author) and told him that I could help him
  if he wanted.
  He expected that he would post a new version by the end of this month.

- I started to talk to the engineer who wrote the uhs-ii patch for our SoC.

(misc)
- bug fix[12]
  merged in v2020.07-rc
