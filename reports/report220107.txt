Subject: [Weekly] Week ending 2022-01-07

For Dec 27, Jan 6 and 7.
We had snow in Tokyo last week.

Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).

  I said in the last week:
  - I struggled a bit to set up a bridge which is to connect
    a vm's network interface to the host's local network.
    I haven't succeeded yet to enable a vm to reach a DHCP server
    (actually, a router) in the network to which my PC is attached.
    (If I launch a DHCP server on my PC's nic locally,
    everything works fine though.)

  I was able to fix it by
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables

  This means that we should disable the default iptable rules
  against bridge interfaces to allow for accessing external networks.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  no progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration, RFCv2[2]
  I checked Heinrich's comments and replied to them.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v8[3]
  I checked Heinrich's comments and replied to them.

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
  Kojima-san is now proposing a UI app for UEFI boot manager[5].
  My patch would be a bit helpful so that we don't have to reply on
  distro_bootcmd.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress

=== Issues ===
* boards (MachiatoBin)
  I've got the delivery at the end of December, but the order
  was wrong; the package contained only one SingleShot board.
  I asked Shimada-san to re-order the boards. A new delivery
  date would be early February.
