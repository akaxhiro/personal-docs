[STR-7]/[STR-21]
- continued studying other hypervisors (jailhouse, gunyah) in order to
  understand ã€€how virtio devices are (or can be) implemented on them.

  Gunyah doesn't have any framework yet that would allow for implementation
  device emulation outside the hypervisor (something like IOREQ on Xen)
  but other functional requirements for virtio proxy, like signaling interrupts
  and mapping remote memory, seem to be available (with some restriction?).

  I intend to put my insights from this study into my proposal in some way.

- continued revising my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Hopefully, I would put an entry in the next Stratos meeting
  to present it.
  I'm still modifying it, especially the last few pages, current
  status, comparison and issues though.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* signing feature to mkeficapsule[2]
  no progress, but reviewed a few patches relating to capsule update
  from Ilias.

* Quite interesting question from Simon[3]
  He proposed "verified boot for embedded (VBE)."
  His goal would be almost the same as what EBBR with UEFI aims to do,
  but in U-Boot specific way using the *existing* technologies.

  He seems to want to avoid duplicated features, secure boot and secure
  firmware update, to co-exist in U-Boot, "parallel worlds" in his word.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v1: submitted on 05/12
    uboot/cap misc: submitted on 05/11
    kernel/uhs2  v3.1: submitted on 11/06
    uboot/sbsa    rfc: submitted on 11/04
    uboot/xen-earlyuart v1: submitted on 10/15

=== Issues ===
* So a big question here is whether my approach can be applied/deployed
  to other hypervisors (to meet the goal of STR-7)?
  Who will be able to take care of it at this point?
