Stratos
=======
[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio implementation and
  Continued to talk with with Dan Milea (WindRiver).

  My current concern with this approach is whether the shared memory regions
  defined in the draft virtio spec v1.2 can be used as "bounce buffers".

  The spec says, "Shared memory regions MUST NOT expose shared memory regions
  which are used to control the operation of the device, nor to stream data."
  What does this text mean?

  If the usage is *legal*, it would be much more generic and preferable
  than a hacky fat virtqueue approach.

* Continued to learn about Argo interfaces and virtio over Argo.
  I'm gonna ask Christpher for better understanding about his idea
  on virtio-over-Argo.

[STR-21]
  Dmytro updated his current work on this card.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[1]
  Heinrich has said nothing yet even after I pinged him several times,
  asking whether he agree that we won't add partition-table devices for now.

  So I modified the patches based on the comments that I have got so far.
  I'm going to post RFC v2 sometime next week.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp
  I submitted v7[2].
  A few comments from Heinrich; one is trivial and the others are
  false claims.

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[3].
  No progress
