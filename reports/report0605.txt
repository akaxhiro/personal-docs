# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot v7[5]
  No comments to my patches against Coverity errors[6].

- "intermediate certificates" issue
  I finally got a comment to my patch (RFC) for sbsigntools from
  James (Bottomley). Since he basically agreed to add this feature,
  I posted a new version[7] per his comment.

  Regarding preparatory patch[8], I got a few comments from Heinrich.
  Some were trivial, but there is one that I can't agree with.

  Meanwhile, I was preparing to post version 1 of intermediate certificates
  support and I thought I had done. But at the last moment, I found
  a problem in handling an image with multiple signatures.
  It will take a few more days to fix it.

- kexec_file for arm
  Some folk(Samsung) submitted a patch for supporting kexec_file_load on arm.
  Actually, some code was derived from the one I wrote for arm64.
  Not too bad, but I'm also worried that some defects might be
  detected in reviews, especially by RMK :)
  So far, no problems.
