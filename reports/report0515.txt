# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure

- No updates on Bugzilla[4].
  I also directly e-mailed to the guys, one from Arm and one from Intel,
  assigned to this issue.  No response.

# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot v7[5]
  No comments to my patches against Coverity errors[6].

- "intermediate certificates" issue
  I asked Joakim(&David Brown) and Ard about signing tools
  that support intermediate certificates, but got no direct
  feedback.

  So I finally decided to modify an existing tool, sbsign,
  to allow for adding extra intermediate certificates into
  a signature of PE image. Done :) (Just 40 lines of change)

  Then I started to write some simple test cases for pytest,
  and now confirmed that the code works as expected for
  success cases (that is, a signature was eventually verified 
  by Root CA in "db").
  But it still fails for failure cases (that is, the verification
  should be revoked by "dbx").

  I'm going to review my current logic of building up
  a "certificate chain" before verification, and improve it
  to make it compatible with openssl's (hence EDK2's) behavior,
  at least, to some extent.

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- v1 of capsule update patch[7]
  No progress on my patch (I see no critical issues)

  I and Sughosh discussed about FMP drivers, and I suggested that
  we can use UEFI's block io protocol to actually update the firmware
  data on whatever the underlying device is.
  I think that he now has enough ideas for the future direction,
  a generic (universal) FMP driver.

- Discussions about runtime variable access support in Boot-arch ML[8]
  No progress seen in ML
  (Heinrich seems to be keen to get involved with discussion of
  device tree stuffs :)

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [9]

- Pinged Ben (the patch author).
  I gave him some suggestions about what issue be dealt with in first
  priority at this moment to drive him forward.

  I've also got URL of his local repository, and looked into it.
  It seems, not surprisingly, that he has made almost no change
  since the patch he submitted in January.
