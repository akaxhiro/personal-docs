[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[1][2][3]

  I spent some time to try to understand Ulf's changes in [3].
  I also pinged Renius, who is now assigned to UHS-2 task,
  replacing Ben.

[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

  Debugging BE code has not been finished, but I have confirmed
  that the xen-related initialization on BE has successfully passed
  and that FE, which is also a Zephyr app, can now communicate with BE
  via MMIO configuration space. That means that Xen's IOREQ server
  for BE is now correctly set up.

  The current issue I have been tackling is that BE fails to map FE's
  ring buffer into BE memory space with Xen's foreignmemory_map() API.
  I have not implemented this interface in advance. I'm not sure
  whether it will be easy to implement or not since Zephyr doesn't
  have ability to add (virtual) memory (mapping) dynamically.

  Hopefully, FE will be able to talk and submit block io requests
  to BE once this issue will be fixed.

  Regarding a security policy issue that I reported last week,
  I bypass it by invoking Xen with xsm=dummy, which allows us to skip
  almost of all security enforcements.
  (But there is one workaround needed.)

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress

- IOREQ on Arm[5] by EPAM
  The patch has now been merged in the upstream.

- Zephyr on Xen[6]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress
