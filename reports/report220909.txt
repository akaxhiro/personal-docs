  TODO: investigate eBPF case

  TODO: find out a generic configuration of bridge to fix multicast issue
  (although this won't have any impact on measured results).

  TODO: With my own benchmark program, I sometimes see that read/readmsg()
  after select() fails.

[STR-92] (Setup for TSN)
* I talked to Alex and we decided to close this card.
  We will take care of more complex cases after members' feedback.
  
[STR-76] Break down the latency
* I continued to consider how we should trace activities, especially, on host/kvm
  side and which functions/events are important for analysis.

  I sorted out a list of function candidates even though it is not perfect yet,
  then attempted to capture traces both for no-background-traffic case
  and with-background-traffic case.
  I will not show all the details of tracing but see page 17 and 18 for
  summary of recorded execution flow around handling a packet from the benchmark program[2].

  The time consumed on the receiver side can be split into 4 time spans:
  a) from interrupt arrival to invocation of interrupt handler
  b) from interrupt handler to wake-up of vhost process
  c) vhost processing to wake-up of kvm process
  d) from kvm wake-up to guest wake-up and packet reception by guest's driver 

As far as this trial is concerned, (a)+(b), (c) and (d) are running
on different processors.

  (usec)  w/o netperf    w/ 3 netperf's
  latency  71             150
  (a)      <= 20           <= 62
  (b)      19              25
  (c)      17              31
  (d)      <= 14           25

  NOTE:
  * Those are NOT mean values, but ones observed in a single packet handling.
  * (a) is not accurate because we don't know exactly when the packet arrived.

At a glance, (a)+(b) seems to contribute most to a gap between the two cases.
Based on the ftrace log, major disturbing factors in (a)+(b) are
  1) interrupt handling for netperf packets
  2) interrupt handling for arch timer

So obvious solution is to disable those interrupts, at least, purge them
to other processors. It appears that we can distribute received packets into different
*hw* rx queues (i225 has 4 queues) based on VLAN ID's.
Combined with kernel's irq affinity mechanism, we may be able to separate benchmark's
packets from netperf load and handle them exclusively on a dedicated processor.

I have no hints about some overheads in (c) or (d) yet.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[3]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Reviewed Sughosh's multibank-fw-update patch (v9)
* Review of secure boot test spec
  TODO: Yet to review the updated test spec[4].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
