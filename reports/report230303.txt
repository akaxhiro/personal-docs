Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* No update on results [1]

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Still continued to investigate a big latency observed  in a long-run (currently
  5 minutes) measurement.

  I tried a couple of changes in settings.
  1) PREEMPT_RT kernel v6.2-rc3
  2) Set up TSN (taprio) on receiver side
  3) fully disable OVS from the startup of the system

  (1) page 36,37 in [2]
  With the patch Alex suggested applied, the kernel (RT v6.2-rc3) successfully
  booted up. But the result looks the same, I mean, it won't resolve a big spike
  of latency issue (> 6000us).

  (2) page 38 in [2]
  I configured TSN on the receiver side in the same way as on the sender side
  (i.e. using the same timeslot definitions). But it won't resolve a disorder
  of PTP.
  As I said before, the root cause is not PTP, but must be the network itself.
  Once the NIC (or driver?) goes into a wrong state, it won't easily be
  recovered, which leads to network slow-down or packet loss.

  (3) page 39,40 and 41 in [2]
  OVS was stopped and disabled for the system not to automatically start
  the service. It seems that a big spike has disappeared, but we see other
  issues (PTP disorder or packet loss).

* I also tried another timeslot definitions so that packets for PTP will be
  transmitted at any of all the gates:
  (before)      (after)
  01    ->      03 101000
  02    ->      02 103000
  04    ->      06 109000
  08    ->      0a 190000

  I used this configuration in the experiments in 'LBO-293' below, but
  it seems to has no effect on the results.
  (Please note that PTP packets are already given the socket priority 5,
  second to packets from the benchmark program (whose priority is now 7.))


[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[3]
* To collect the measurement data for the next blog article,
  I attempted to once again perform tests against network types other than 'tap+bridge'
  in the recent environment/settings.

  See page 37, 43-49 in [2].
  Overall, I could manage to set up the system/network as I did before, but
  I still fail to obtain a stable result against OVS case.
  In addition, I have some difficulty in properly setting up OVS + AF_XDP case.
  (some setting must be missed out.)
  
  Regarding the results, there is an issue; After a long-period run (> 5 minutes,
  mostly when 10-15 minutes has passed), PTP can easily get disordered.

  Even if you think that the graph looks plat (or leveling) before a drift
  starts, there are small spikes.
  (I hope this issue can be resolved by assigning the vhost thread to SCHED_FIFO.)

  So my question is which part of the data should we use to calculate the average
  and determine the worst-case latency?

* I submitted a proposal for my talk at Linaro Connect 2023.
  The title is "Network latency with TSN on Virtual Machine."

  The presentation will be based on a yet-coming blog article mentioned above
  and my past slides for Continental meeting.

U-Boot support
==============
No progress

[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[4]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Made comments on Kojima-san's patch of supporting firmware versions.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress (This topic might be related to UEFI-DM integration).

=== Patch status ===

=== Issues ===
* I still need a PCIE (intel x550 or 82576) card for SR-IOV testing.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Mar 21: Sprint Equinox Day (public holiday)
(Around this week, I may take a week-long vacation.)
