A critical bug in U-Boot's UEFI secure boot was reported.

Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* latest result of latency measurement
  (No update)

  a.user (+ nat): failed
  b.tap + bridge: OK
  c.macvtap: OK
  d.NIC passthrough: suspended/cancelled
  e.OpenVSwitch (as a simple bridge): OK
  f.eBPF-based bridge: OK

  (netperf)
  $ netperf -H 192.168.20.1  -l -1000 -t TCP_RR -w 10ms -b 1 -v 2 -- \

    eBPF (XDP)           221    254    571    13.4

* TODO: Ilias raised a concern about the result of eBPF case, saying
  that the latency should be much smaller than other cases.

[STR-92] (Setup for TSN)
* i225 (TSN NIC card) setup
  After I got Marcin's reply, I tried U-Boot with pci-support *disabled*
  because I saw some discussion, in linux-pci ML, that U-Boot initializes
  pci bus in a different way as Linux does.
  The kernel v5.10 (the Debian 11's) doesn't work, but v5.17 (from
  unstable release) DOES work.

* The initial result (host-to-host, not host-to-vm)  with my own benchmark
  program is as follows:
	$ netperf ...
	   ...
	Minimum      Mean         Maximum      Stddev       Transaction
	Latency      Latency      Latency      Latency      Rate
	Microseconds Microseconds Microseconds Microseconds Tran/s

	90           102.09       246          14.52        9761.240

* At the end, I have never seen any reply from the technical support of SolidRun.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Now that hardware timestamping is available on i225, I tried it.

	 >= 10000:     0
  (don't mind negative values in "wire". They are close to zero anyway.)

   What are strange comparing it with MACCHIATOBin's are
   - the latency is mush shorter although the network speed (2.5Gbps)
     is slower (due to the below?)
   - "tx sw" and "rx sw" have relatively-similar values.

* Please note that the program on i225 is yet a bit unstable as I sometimes
  see that read/readmsg() after select() fails.

* No update on the report[1].

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[2]
  No progress. The patch for testing is yet to be merged.

(MISC)
* A critical bug in UEFI secure boot was privately reported
  by a Siemens engineer
  I don't disclose it here, but it causes fatal vulnerability,
  and we will probably have to issue a CVE incident.

  I have already created a bug fix against this issue, and further
  continued to investigate whether a similar problem exist.

  I currently defer to Ilias about what action we should take next.
  (He wanted that he had his internal review on the patch.)

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[3]
  No progress
* Reviewed Kojima-san's efimenu patch.
* Reviewed Sughosh's FWUPDATE v5.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/short_path v2: partially merged in v2022.07-rc4
    uboot/uefi removable rfc: merged in v2022.07-rc2
    uboot/disk_integ v5: merged in v2022.07-rc1

=== Issues ===
* I still need a PCIE (intel x550 or 82576) card for SR-IOV testing.
