# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- Bugzilla[1].
  No comment from Samer (Arm).

[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

- I wonder what are planed tasks for dependable boot in the current
  development cycle.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Submitted patch v7[2]
  Actually, I posted "RESEND v6" first, but Tom indicated that I had
  missed to address one comment. So modified and sent out v7 quickly.

  Tom simply gave me "Reviewed-by". He could have done so much earlier in v6.

- capsule authentication[3]
  I haven't seen any post from Sughosh this week.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  Did cleanups for submission[5].
  I'm now waiting for Ben's final check and test.

[LBI-40] / Stratos (?)
- Trial of Xen guest vm
  Now I'm trying to run Open-AMP application on Zephyr.
  As you know, Open-AMP talks to some sort of virtio interfaces
  and can be a possible framework/solution for non-linux OS's.

  I can build the library with Zephyr, but no practical app is found.
  I asked Kumar but didn't get useful information.

- Continued to discuss about some issues with Stefano and Julien.
  We need some tweaks around Zephyr's GIC initialization as well as
  interrupt masking when an interrupt handler is called.

  I'm not confident that the arm64 (for qemu a53) implementation
  in Zephyr is quite mature. (probably not)

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress

- sbsa-uart driver for U-Boot
  The current xen'ized U-Boot utilizes a para-virtualized console
  interface. I'm trying to implement sbsa-uart driver instead.
  (So along with semihosting, we can hopefully use U-Boot on other hypervisor's
  vm although kvm supports full virtualization of pl011.)

  In this effort, I found a bug in Xen (strictly speaking, xl command),
  and Stefano posted a bug fix to xen-devel ML[7].

  With this patch, my driver works well.
  Yet we need one tweak on U-Boot, though. We have to disable
  data cache. (but I don't know why.)

  Probably I will post the patch as RFC next week.
