# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

- I'm going to review the existing secure boot related JIRA cards
  aiming to close some of them if appropriate.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Submitted v8[2]
  Added minor updates, in particular, against test failures.
  I don't see any blocking factors for upstream other than "virt-make-fs"
  issue.

- capsule authentication[3]
  I haven't seen any post from Sughosh yet.

- UHS2 support[4],[5]
  No comments so far and I don't anticipate any comments in the coming
  few weeks given such an extensive rework.

  I started to implement (or at least, prototype) a virtio frontend
  driver on Zephyr using Open-AMP library.
  Here the virtio device is a block device since it is the only available
  device type supported with Xen's IOREQ patch that is under review in
  Xen-dev ML.

  In this effort, I hit a problem that any read/write to a "configuration"
  space of a virtio device fails, resulting in data abort.

  After many 'cut and try' changes, I found that the mmio region needs to
  be "memory-mapped" on a guest vm so that Xen can trap such an access
  and emulate the device.

  But it sounds weird, and I am discussing this issue with Stefano
  and Julien. I think of an possibility of a qemu bug, considering
  all the evidences I have.

  I spent almost three days in investigating this issue, with no
  good progress in implementing a virtio driver itself. I hope, however,
  that finishing the experimental code will not take more than one week.

  Debugging is a different issue :)

- Continued to discuss about GIC-related issues on Zephyr with Stefano
  and Julien.
  Julien has proposed a fix (or workaround) as he observed a "spurious"
  interrupt around a normal interrupt occurrence.

  He also hinted there may be another problem around interrupt injections
  by qemu. No details yet.

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress

- sbsa-uart driver for U-Boot[7]
  I mentioned a "cache" issue in my last week's report.
  I'm almost certain that it is directly linked to the problem mentioned
  above (Xen's mmio emulation).
