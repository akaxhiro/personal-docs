[STR-73] (Setup for passthrough NIC)
* enabling VFIO for NIC (mvpp2)
  - After discussions, I and Alex agreed to hold further efforts for pursuing
    possibility of using on-chip NIC in pass-through mode.

* enabling VFIO for PCIe devices
  - no progress
  - I want to close STR-73 and create another sub-story (card) for vfio-pci
    (and SR-IOV) trial.
  - Then, I will suspend the task until I will get a NIC pcie card.
    I'm now asking Alex if Linaro will buy some NIC cards (with SR-IOV support
    and/or TSN support) for me.

[STR-74] Setup for Open vSwitch
* closed the card.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* I and Alex discussed the emulation of automotive application (in terms of
  system load/network traffic) under latency measurement environment.
      a. one task for streaming from a back-view camera (latency-conscious)
      b. another task for car navigation with massive map data (bulk net traffic)

  Then, I created a simple test scenario:
      A. netperf latency test (TCP_RR, VM -> host -> VM)
      B. netperf burst-transfer test (TCP_MAERTS, host -> VM)

    We *don't know* how many VM's are there and how much impact they might have
    on CPU load/scheduling/memory pressure/interrupts and so on.
    So take a measurement for host-to-host first.

    host-to-host (not VM) latency (us):

                           min    avg      max  stddev
                           ---    ---      ---  ------
        A only             178    200      433      9.14
        A+B on diff cpus   236    968   207847   9249
        A+B on same cpu    214   1146   207362  13053

    Apparently, we see a very bad worst-case latency.

* Please note that these measure values are a round-trip time, not an uni-directional
  delay to be observed in (a).
  To get more precise data for one-way trip latency, IEEE-1588 support
  (PTP: Precise Time Protocol) will be required and we will have to develop
  a dedicated benchmark program.

* I also wonder: if a guarantee of a worst-case latency is a mandatory requirement,
  we have no other choice than using a TSN-capable NIC via VFIO at a guest VM.
  Why do we want to try/investigate other network configurations as I have been done now. 

  I think we should re-assure ourselves what is the ultimate goal and what assumptions
  & requirements we can/should assume in this trial.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* I submitted v5[1].
  I had to make a small change to v4 to align with a change in another patch[2] which is
  a reworked version of patch I sent as an RFC last week.
  Then, I also posted a follow-up patch[3].

(MISC)
* No update from Kojima-san on his bootmenu v4[4]
  It contains (part of) my removable media patch[5].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress

* reviewed Ilias' patch for sha384/512 support.
