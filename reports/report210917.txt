[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Waiting for any comments on ML[2], the only related comment from Stefano:

  "In my experience, latency, performance, and security are far more
  important than providing a single binary.
  (snip)
  Instead of virtio-proxy, my suggestion is to work together on a common
  project and common source with others interested in the same problem."

- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  How should we drive the discussion further ahead?
  Alex posted, saying "Is it time to start implementing Xen bindings
  for rust-vmm?"

- Looked into the implementation of vhost-user library, in particular,
  how Xen's IOREQ counterpart is implemented in kvm/qemu.

(MISC)
- [STR-21]
  Mike asked me for estimated remaining efforts.
  I said that we could close the card since I had seen no major issues
  in running Zephyr on Xen.

- U-Boot support
* mkeficapsule v3[4]
  no progress seen on the discussion about where to save a public key
  for capsule authentication

- Bootflow/bootmethod proposal on U-Boot[5],[6]
  No visible progress.

- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's device model) integration
  Since I don't know when the next cycle plan for Stratos will be fixed
  and what the plan looks like, I temporarily focus on this integration
  issue.
  Based on my past experimental code[7], I have been working on
  revised patch series for integrating efi_disk into DM framework.
  So far I've done:
  * create disk partition udevices
  * detect partitions automatically at probing
  * create/delete efi_disk objects automatically per block device/
    partition
  * re-work FAT filesystem using udevices instead of blk_descs

  Those changes, however, doesn't lead to reducing the total code size
  in UEFI subsystem.

- Ilias created (TS-118), "U-Boot Driver model and EFI integration."

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[8]
  no progress seen this week
