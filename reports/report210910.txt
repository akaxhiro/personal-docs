[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Waiting for any comments on ML[2], but nothing after five weeks.

- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  1) Arm guy (Wei Chen) is also trying to build
  2) a proposal for kvm to add "MMIO/PIO dispatch" mechanism[5]
  3) Matias talks about his experience about his hypervisor-agnostic PoC
  4) Oleksandr(EPAM) is now proposing to add a new hypervisor interface[6]
     to Xen, which allows for creating the mapping of the whole FE memory
     space to BE at the beginning
  5) Christopher explained Argo framework on Xen, which is a hypervisor-
     agnostic inter-domain communication mechanism.

  I kept talking to Christopher about Argo framework for the purpose of
  understanding it better.

- I'm still trying to contact some engineers:

  1) Intel: who has proposed msi-x support for virtio-mmio at linux kernel
     a year ago, aiming to improve the performance under multiple virt queues.
  2) Another Intel guy: who implemented ivshmem driver on Zephyr.
  3) Qualcomm: I'm asking for any comments on my proposal

I got a reply from the guy (2). He said he had no plan to do with
ivshmem and that ACRN[7] now has virtio device support.

So I looked into ACRN's virtio implementation. In short,
  * ACRN host one Service VM, which seems to hehave like Xen's dom0
    or kvm host kernel.
  * transport: virtio-pci only(?)
  * All virtio BEs work on Service VM.
  * BE as a user process should collaborate with "Device Model" (or DM)
    which will bridge a user space and kernel/hypervisor.
    It works like qemu (as VMM, I guess).
  * Virtio BE can be implemented in three ways (frameworks):
    - User-Land Virtio          : control/data in user
    - Kernel-Land Virtio        : control in user, data in kernel
    - Vhost                     : control/data in kernel
      (not exact same as linux's)
  * Differences are where 'control plane' and 'data plane' are handled.

From the technical POV, at least, it's quite interesting.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* mkeficapsule v3[8]
  the discussion about where to save a public key for capsule authentication
  is still in a *chaotic* situation.

- Bootflow/bootmethod proposal on U-Boot[9],[10]
  No visible progress. As far as UEFI manager is concerned, Simon
  seems to have no good knowledge about specification as well as
  implementation.

- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's device model) integration
  The discussion above about bootflow reminded us of the integration
  issue, which I reported from time to time.
  So I attempted to forward-port my old patch[11] to upstream,
  and fixed some issues. (Unlike my original patch, I just tried
  to manage UEFI disks (BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL objects) in this prototype.
  The creation of those objects are coupled with the device model's
  probe mechanism (at least, to some extent :).

  Ilias also told me that he would propose this issue as a Linaro's
  new task to member companies.

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[12]
  Ulf made a few comments.
