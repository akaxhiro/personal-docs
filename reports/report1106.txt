# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- Bugzilla[1].
  No comment from Samer (Arm).

[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

- I wonder what are planed tasks for dependable boot in the current
  development cycle.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- v7[2]
  Heinrich indicated that we hade test failures on Travis CI.
  The error looks weird and I have not reproduced it in my local
  environment. Moreover, It is actually on secure boot test, not
  on capsule update test.
  While I didn't find out the *root cause,* I managed to fix it
  after several "cut and try" attempts.

  Meanwhile, Tom also mentioned another issue on Travis CI. He requested
  that all tests should pass or be skipped, instead of failure, if there
  is a missing or not-working component on CI environment.
  (Namely, virt-make-fs command in some python scripts doesn't
  work as it is installed by Ubuntu.)

  We have been discussing about this issue for some time. I can add
  a kind of fail-safe handling using sudo command. The issue is that
  Heinrich has rejected such a solution in the past and will not.

  So far, I have seen his comment on this.

- capsule authentication[3]
  I haven't seen any post from Sughosh this week.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support
  Although I didn't get Ben's final test result, I posted the new version
  as RFC v3.1[4],[5].

  This version contains only my changes on 'sdhci' side as Ben is still
  working on 'host' side and have not finished his work.
  The aim is to get early feedback from Adrian regarding modularising
  sdhci-uhs2 component as extensive rework has already been made on code
  structure.

(Misc)
[LBI-40] / Stratos (?)
- Trial of Xen guest vm
  Now I successfully ran my Open-AMP application on Zephyr.
  Two threads talk with each other using rpmsg interfaces which
  communicate via virtio channels.

  The next steps that I have in my mind are:
  * Run two Open-AMP apps on two guest vm's to talk to each other.
    (First of all, I have to learn how we can set up "shared memory"
    between vm's and how we can signal an interrupt from one vm to another.)
  * Implement a real virtio frontend driver with Open-AMP (virtio).
    I started to look into linux implementation of virtio-mmio.
  * Study how we can directly build up a virtio device backend on zephyr.
    (Alex seems to have started his study with vhost-user library on linux.)

- Continued to discuss about GIC-related issues on Zephyr with Stefano
  and Julien.
  No progress, but Julien (Arm) is now trying to reproduce the issue
  in his environment.

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress

- Submitted sbsa-uart driver for U-Boot[7]
  This is also an RFC since there is some weird workaround necessary;
  Data cache must be turned off on U-Boot. Apparently, caching has
  nothing to do with uart emulation (which is nothing but memory-mapped
  registers), but U-Boot will hang at early boot stage without this tweak.
