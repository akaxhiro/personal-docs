# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  No progress seen in ML.

# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- No updates on Bugzilla[4].

  assigned to this issue.  No response.

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot v7[5]
  No comments to my patches against Coverity errors[6].

- "intermediate certificates" issue
  I posted a patch (RFC) for sbsigntools[7].
  This was aimed to get more feedbacks about "intermediate
  certificates" support in the market.

  No response (The ML has only three subscribers :)

  I continued to rework the code to enable intermediate
  certificates in a signature. It will take a few more days
  in the next week.

- Ilias' OP-TEE(StandaloneMM)-based variables implementation
  has been merged at v2020.07-rc2.

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- v1 of capsule update patch[8]
  No progress on my patch (I see no critical issues)

  I had some discussions with Sughosh, and he is now thinking of
  extending my FIT-based FMP driver for generic use instead of
  his own way.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [9]

- Pinged Ben (the patch author).
  It seems that he just started to modify his code.
