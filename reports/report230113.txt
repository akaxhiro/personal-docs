Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* No update on results [1]

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Still continued to investigate a big latency observed  in a long-run (currently
  5 minutes) measurement.

  As of the last week, I observed two issues:
  1. PTP clock may get disordered and not converging to the master clock
  2. Latencies can surge sparsely but periodically (at every 20-25 seconds)
  (See the page 21 in [1].)

  Looking into the log by ptp4l app (which implements the PTP protocol to
  synchronise PTP clocks on NICs), I found a strange behavior:
  - Once netperf is started, the slave (i.e. the host hosting a guest VM)
    seems to lose the remote master node and switch the master to the local
    clock
  - The app waits about 2^4 (=16) seconds, expecting that the network
    link is *reset* and gets back to the normal.
  - Then, restart selecting a new master clock.

  This process was repeated one after the other and as the time (of
  executing netperf) went on, the delta between the master and the local clock
  seems to get large to unmanageable level, leaving the local clock disordered.

  PTP has a mechanism to settle this kind of divergence by adopting
  "PI(Proportional Integral) control" against the local clock's frequency,
  but it seems that it eventually failed to do so under my current configuration.

* After many trial-and-error's, I somehow managed to solve the problem #2.
  (See the graphs on the right side in the page 21).

  What I did on the slave (the host hosting the guest VM) were:
  - added/modified parameters on ptp4l (& phc2sys) app
      socket_priority=7         send PTP packets with higher priority
      step_threshold=1          jump the local clock instead of adjusting
                                   the clock frequency
      tx_timestamp_timeout=5    avoid timeout of not seeing tx timestamps
      BMCA=noop                 -+
      slaveOnly=1                |- enforce the slave role
      inhibit_announce=1         |
      ignore_source_id=1        -+
      follow_up_info=1          ??? (but no doubt it has a big impact)
  - set up *mqprio* (but not taprio) on the NIC to prioritise PTP packets
  - changed the scheduling class and the priority of ptp4l
    to SCHED_FIFO with priority 90 (i.e. under real time scheduler)

=== update Jan 16 ===
I'm trying "automotive profile of PTP", which includes most of
parameters above.
=== ===

  To be honest, I don't yet know exactly which factors/changes helped
  improve the situation.

* There exist a couple of outstanding issues though.
  2a. Latencies still surge sparsely but periodically (at every 60 seconds this time)
  3. The average latency increases gradually and steadily as the time goes on
     (the page 21 in [1])
  4. The average may not always be low enough (due to the fact (3)?)
     (the page 22)
  5. Without follow_up_info option, we see some ripples periodically
     (the page 23)
  6. If the netperf workload is TCP (i.e. TCP_STREAM), the result looks
     a bit different.
     (the page 24)

  As the situation is improved, more issues emerge :)

U-Boot support
==============
No progress

[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[3]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[4]
  No progress (This topic might be related to UEFI-DM integration).
