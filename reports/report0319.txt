[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

I'm currently not certain what I should do for the next step of this study,
and so I'm trying to run "dom0-less" version of this demo.
(This will make sense, particularly, for BE.)

The first step is to simplify the loading path by eliminating U-Boot
as a boot loader of Zephyr app. This means that the code should be
rebased to the upstream version of Xen support, "xenvm" board, instead of
my own patch.
In rebasing, I found that most of bugs that I had found and fixed
on Zephyr code have been also fixed in the upstream. So I won't have to
submit any outstanding batches in my repository.

Now FE and BE app can start directly with "xl create" command.
What I don't like regarding "xenvm" support are:
- it by default uses GIC v2, not v3.
- it enables SBSA version of PL011 driver.
  With this serial driver on as a console, we cannot see the output
  on the console immediately after "xl create" command. We additionally
  have to connect the console with "xl console" command.

I'm going to try to set up the entire system with dom0-less configuration
next week (actually, the week after next).

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress

- IOREQ on Arm[5] by EPAM
  The patch has now been merged in the upstream.

- Zephyr on Xen[6]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress
