# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- Bugzilla[1].
  I've got a comment from Samer (Arm). He said that FWTS (FirmWare
  Test Suite from Ubuntu) covered "image authentication."

  It's pointless. I know the test case and know that it doesn't
  test "image authentication."

[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v6[2]
  No new comments on ML.
  I will re-post the patch after rc-1 merge window is closed(10/26).

- capsule authentication[3]
  I haven't seen any post from Sughosh this week.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  I and Ben have had a couple of iterations of updating the patch[5]
  and running/testing the code.

  After I reworked interrupt handling on sdhci, the driver can successfully
  detect and initialize an UHS-2 card.
  Yet I don't know that Ben was able to access data on a card.

(Misc)
[LBI-40] / Stratos (?)
- Trial of Xen guest vm
  We can't start Zephyr directly on domU yet, but now can load and
  run it from U-Boot(!). The only change needed is to modify U-Boot's
  "bootelf" command by disabling and invalidating data cache before
  jumping into the entry address.
  (Qemu's TLB seems to be to blame.)

  Regarding Zephyr, I somehow successfully ran "Hello World" application.
  But we need a couple of tweaks around interrupt handling on Zephyr.
  I'm going to continue to discuss about this issue with Stefano and
  Julien.

  For console output, I currently use a hypervisor service for debugging
  and so it is "output only". To fully para-virtualize the console,
  we need to port a lot of xen features like xenbus, event channels,
  grant tables and so on.

- I believe that we should definitely have some tool that allows us to
  debug the binary on a guest vm in an effective manner.
  I pinged Xendbg's author again, but have not received any reply yet.

  The only option that I can come up with is "Fast Model" with RealView
  debugger. It can allow us to access a different memory space in
  a different exception level.

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  I've got a bit lazy feedbacks from the maintainer.
