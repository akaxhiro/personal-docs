[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v6[2]
  No new comments on ML.
  I will re-post the patch after rc-1 merge window is closed(10/26).

- capsule authentication[3]
  Sughosh said that he needed another week to finish his code.
  It seems that he is doing something different from what I have anticipated.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  I and Ben have had a couple of iterations of updating the patch
  and running/testing the code.

  At present, the driver can now detect an UHS-2 interface.
  But the succeeding initialization, especially receiving a response of
  a command, fails.

(Misc)
[LBI-40] / Stratos (?)
- I'm playing with a couple of guest vm's:
    U-Boot (upstream 2020.10): OK (then, of course, linux)
    Zephyr (upstream): NG

  It seems that none of loaders supported in Xen (strictly libguest) cannot
  handle Zephyr properly (either a plain binary or a ELF binary).
  Stefano suggested that we may use U-Boot as a bootloader for Zephyr.

  I hope that Xen's efiloader will be usable if some code of Xen-specific
  handling can be removed.
  (The entry point of Zephyr is in the middle of binary, so we can't
  simply use Xen's bin- (or armzImage-) loader.)

- One of issues in future development would be 'debugging' the code running
  on a vm. While I'm looking for something like gdbserver, Stefano pointed
  out xendbg. Since it supports x86 only right now, I'm contacting the author
  about porting it to arm64.
  In this effort, I also learned how to print debug messages via a hypervisor
  call. I applied this to U-Boot and implemented DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's
  earlyprintk. Submitted the patch[6].

- Started to study virtio specification (OASIS) as well as implementation
  in U-Boot (as its code has less volume than other implementation :)

  Stefano pointed out a recently posted patch-set that enables virtio
  on Xen. I will also look into it.
