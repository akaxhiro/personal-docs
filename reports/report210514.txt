[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- no progress
  As the discussion about my patches on UEFI capsule update has been
  heating up this week, I had no time to work on virtio.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
  I posted a number of small patches[1] that fix various minor issues
  on the current implementation of capsule authentication.

  Those are prerequisite patches for capsule signing below.

- Add signing feature to mkeficapsule
  Sughosh assumes that we should use EDK-II's python script
  to sign a capsule file, but it seems to me that it makes
  no sense at all while we are users of U-Boot!

  The solution that I proposed[2] is to add signing feature to
  mkeficapsule command which will now allow us to create and sign
  a capsule file.

  The patch[2] has ignited unpleasant discussions that are still
  ongoing on ML.

(FYI)
- I claimed Li Gong that he should have shared his recent message,
  "Re-Imagining Engineering at Linaro," with assignees as well as
  employees as it will surely have substantial impacts on assignee's
  development efforts. (As you notice, he initially posted it only
  to employees.)
