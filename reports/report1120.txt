[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

- Reviewed the existing secure boot related JIRA cards.
  I will close them since Vincent has agreed.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Submitted v9[2]
  As some patches in v8 have already been merged, I posted the rest
  (with some additional follow-up's) as v9.

  I hope that this will be the final one.

- capsule authentication[3]
  I haven't seen any post from Sughosh yet.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support[4],[5]
  No comments so far and I don't anticipate any comments in the coming
  few weeks given such an extensive rework.

- Trial of Xen guest vm

  Continued working on implementing a virtio frontend driver (block
  device) on Zephyr using Open-AMP library. The base code for block
  device driver comes from Linux (drivers/block/virtio_blk.c).

  It will take more time than I expected, assumingly one more week?,
  partly because I will have to learn how interrupts should be handled
  on Zephyr and partly because there are some differences in 'virtqueue'
  handling interfaces in Linux and Open-AMP.

  I found some interesting things:
  * OASIS specification defines two types of virtqueue layouts, split
    and packed, but Open-AMP supports only 'split', which I think
    is the legacy layout.
  * Linux's block device driver utilises a 'feature,' F_MQ or multiple
    queues support, which is not defined in OASIS specification.

- Last week, I reported a weird behavior in reading a configuration space
  of a virtio device, but it's not a bug of qemu or whatever else since
  I didn't understand that only IPA, or intermediate physical address,
  does matter to EL2.

- Continued to discuss about GIC-related issues on Zephyr with Stefano
  and Julien.
  The bug that Julien hinted last week was a known issue of qemu and has
  been fixed some time ago.

  I will post Julien's first bug fix to Zephyr ML anyway.

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress
