# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Submitted v10[1]
  And now it got merged (which will appear in the coming -rc4).

- capsule authentication[2]
  I took a quick look at it and didn't like his approach.
  But I don't have enough time yet to make comments.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[3]
  Addressed most of all Adrian's first comments, will yet have to
  take care of the additional ones.

  Meanwhile, I asked Ben when he expected that he would be able to
  get back to his uhs2 task, but haven't got any answer.

  Adding block IO code, I think that the coding was done, at least,
  as prototype work.
  Now I started debugging on 'Xen with IOREQ patch'[4] on qemu.

- Continued to discuss about GIC-related issues on Zephyr with Stefano
  and Julien.
  The patch is ready, but I had no time to submit the patch this week.

- Zephyr on Xen[5]
  No progress, at least, on my side.

  One person (Nataliya, personal?) promoted herself to taking STR-11.

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress
