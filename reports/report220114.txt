Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).

* I tried and successfully configured other choices of network interfaces:
  - macvtap
    qemu-system-x86_64 ... -netdev tap,fd=3, ... 3<> /dev/tapX
  - tap + Open VSwitch (as a bridge)
    From user operation's viewpoint, it looks to be exactly the same
    as with a linux bridge:
    ovs-vsctl add-br tmpovsbr0
    ovs-vsctl add-port tmpovsbr0 enp5s0
    qemu -netdev tap,br=tmpovsbr0,script=...,downscript=... ...

   I also tried to experiment with
   - passthrough of NIC
   as I found there is a kernel option that allows for a "non-iommu"
   mode for VFIO:
      /sys/module/vfio/parameters/enable_unsafe_noiommu_mode
   (Note that my old PC(i7-2600K+H67) doesn't have an IOMMU.)

   But qemu doesn't support this mode, still accessing /dev/vfio/X instead
   of /dev/vfio/noiommu-X. An RFC was posted before but it was not accepted.

* I'm going to try other configurations next week or later:
  - tap + AF_XDP-enabled OVS
    The home page says that AF_XDP support on OVS is still experimental,
    and probably the option is not enabled by default on Ubuntu and
    other distro's. (I need to confirm this.)

    AF_XDP-based OVS has some advantage in performance since it will
    execute most of routing works in user space. I found an interesting
    LPC2020 presentation[1] where some comparison among kernel brdige,
    AF_XDP-based OVS and DPDK-based OVS was made. According to this document,
    DPDK-based OVS still out-performs over AF_XDP-base OVS.

  - XDP (as a simple L2 bridge or L3 switch)
    I just started to learn how such a bridge-like program can be
    written in eBPF and how it should be installed and configured
    on the system.
    But as this technology is relatively new and yet evolving these days,
    I haven't found a lot of information or documents.

    The only (and best) article that I found on this subject was [2].
    I hope that sample programs in [2] will be easily re-used without much
    modification for my experiment, but I will still have to learn how
    BPF maps, a kind of key-value database for packet routings, should be
    configured and loaded into the kernel.

    The same author has another article[3] posted, in which he compared XDP
    with OVS (but I don't think it will be AF_XDP-based OVS) in terms of
    CPU consumption.

  - I hesitate to experiment with the configuration above on my PC
    since it can accidentally crash the kernel and corrupt my system
    in unrecoverable way.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v8: submitted on 12/20
    uboot/disk_integ rfc2: submitted on 12/10
    uboot/uefi removable rfc: submitted on 11/09

=== Issues ===
* boards (MachiatoBin)
  I've got the delivery at the end of December, but the order
  was wrong; the package contained only one SingleShot board.
  I asked Shimada-san to re-order the boards. A new delivery
  date would be early February.

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
Feb 11: National Foundation Day (public holiday)
Feb 23: Emperor's Birthday (public holiday)
