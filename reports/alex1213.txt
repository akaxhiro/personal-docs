* network latency measurements
  - experimentally trying network confguration on my desktop PC:
      * ip-fowarding/NAT
      * tap+bridge
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
      * macvtap
        ip link add link eth0 name macvtap0 address 52:54:00:b8:9c:58 \
		type macvtap mode bridge
	qemu ... -netdev tap,id=net0,fd=3 ... 3<> /dev/tap12

  - Next
      * open vSwitch (w/ XDP?)
  - Not possible as my PC doesn't have iommu.
      * PCI passthrough(VFIO) and/or SR-IOV

  - System configuration
    OS (Ubuntu Desktop may have too much stuff on network?)
    vmm (libvirt?)
    VMs on sender side, receiver side or both?
    (latency is mostly an issue on sender side.)

* MACCHIATObin
  - A wrong order of purchase
  - early Febuary (shipped from Israel?)

    => What to do until then?

* automtive demo
  - Kojima-san used to be working on evaluating TSN on DeveloperBox
