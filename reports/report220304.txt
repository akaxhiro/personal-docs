Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to set up MACCHIATOBin boards.
  I managed to install Debian to eMMC and now am able to boot the system.

  The upstream U-Boot seems not to be able to handle eMMC's boot partitions
  (boot0 or boot1) properly and so I used Marvell's downstream repository
  to build a bit newer version of U-Boot.

  I still have difficulty in booting the firmware (TF-A&U-Boot) on eMMC
  and need to start Debian on eMMC with U-Boot on SPI-ROM.

  The configuration on SPI-ROM is
  TF-A: Upstream v2.5
  BL2: Marvell's binaries-marvell-armada-SDK10.0.1.0
  U-Boot (BL33): Marvell's u-boot-2018.03-armada-18.12

  On eMMC,
  boot0: same as SPI (but it doesn't work)
  data partition: Debian Bullseye (11.2.0)
                  uname -v: SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18)

* installed a guest vm
  I first booted *netinst* image with U-Boot and the installation of
  Debian has failed at the last moment ("install grub"), probably,
  since U-Boot EFI doesn't support variable runtime service.
  So I had to install grub and set up grub.cfg manually :)

  U-Boot: mainline v2022.04-rc2
  system: Debian Bullseye (11.2.0)
          uname -v: SMP Debian 5.10.92-1 (2022-01-18)
          kvm --version: 5.2.0 (Debian 1:5.2+dfsg-11+deb11u1)

  For network configurations,
  - nat: doesn't work yet
  - tap + bridge: OK
  - macvtap: OK
  - NIC passthrough: not tried yet
  - OpenVSwitch (as a simple bridge): not tried yet
  - eBPF-based bridge: not tried yet

* made a first try to measure the network latency
  I first tried iperf but got some weired result (negative values
  for the latency) and so switched to netperf (and ping).

  Here is the first round of result in mcvtap configuration (in ms):
  (netperf)
  $ netperf -H 192.168.20.1  -l -1000 -t TCP_RR -w 10ms -b 1 -v 2 -- \
      -O min_latency,mean_latency,max_latency,stddev_latency,transaction_rate

                         min    avg    max    stddev
  host2-to-host1         180    203    408    8.5
  vm(on host2)-to-host1  275    309    691    16.4

  (ping)
  $ ping 192.168.20.1 -c 10

                         min    avg    max    stddev
  host2-to-host1         170    184    209    11
  vm(on host2)-to-host1  311    328    380    18

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration v2[2]
  I dug into the issue (a test failure at UT) but found no clue.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp (capsule authentication) v11[3]
  no progress on a follow-up patch (for enabling capsule authentication
  test on sandbox)

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
