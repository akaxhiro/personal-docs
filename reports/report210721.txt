This week ends today thanks to Olympics in Japan.

[STR-7]/[STR-21]
- continued revising my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Now I'm trying to have some discussions with Jailhouse guy(Jan Kiszka)
  and Gunyah guy(Carl van Schaik) after disclosing my draft[1] to them.

  I have some valuable (but mixed) comments from Jan, whereas I see no response
  from Carl yet.
  One of Jan's concerns, which I have not been very concious about, is
  "focus on mmio is suboptimal - too many users are PCI-based".
  He also called on paying attention to "fast data paths like vDPA"
  although the performance is not my first priority now.

- Mike (Homes) casted doubt on the future of my study.
  I don't know yet what he is really expecting.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* respined my old follow-up patches and reposted them as v2[2].
  All the patches are now rebased on Ilias' patch.
  In his patch, the place for storing a public key was changed
  from a device tree to U-Boot binary. But this has raised another
  concern from Simon.

* signing feature to mkeficapsule[3]
  Preparing for posting v2.

  Unfortunately, Ilias' patch made it difficult to add
  test cases in existing scripts because the public key must now be
  embedded in part of U-Boot's build process, which is difficult to
  control from pytest framework.

=== Issues ===
* So a big question here is whether my approach can be applied/deployed
  to other hypervisors (to meet the goal of STR-7)?
  Who will be able to take care of it at this point?
