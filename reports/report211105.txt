Stratos
=======
* Alex suggested that I might take STR-66, "Research hypervisor mediated
  copy approaches including Argo.
  He pointed out another work, hypervisor-less virtio, by WindRiver.

  I think that such kind of research work should cover a wider (not
  exhaustive :) list of implementations available now, including ivshmem.

[STR-21]
  Some guy (Dmytro) reported his *current* work on this card.
  I believe that most of his work is duplicated tasks I have already done
  in my virtio-proxy study.
  Since my goal was to provide hypervisor-agnostic solution (on Zephyr),
  I didn't want to upstream Xen-related interface support, like
  event channel/xebus/Xen hypercalls.

  I wonder why this card has not been closed while we agreed to do so
  almost one month ago.

[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[1]
  Simon and Heinrich still insisted that we should a special node (device)
  of 'partition table' in DM tree:
    BLK(whole disk) -> PARTITION_TABLE -> PARTITION -> BLK(partition)

  But I don't understand what is the benefit behind their idea.
  We still have some gap before reaching some consensus.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-102]
- Ilias assigned me to this card.
- mkeficapsule
  I submitted v6[2].
  While I expected that most of all patches were now accepted (at least,
  acked by Simon), two new issues arose:
  - The tool fails to build on *OpenBSD* host.
    The problem is that this host tool includes some efi header from
    U-Boot tree, but it contains a target(and OS)-dependent type definition
    (kernel_size_t).
  - Simon wants the feature provided by this tool to be implemented
    (or at least, integrated) in binman utility.
    Binman is a tool for packaging various type of binaries and data
    into a distribution package although it is not quite popular
    outside U-Boot build&CI process.

* preparing a patch for "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager
  UEFI specification requires that, if the path specified in "BootXXXX"
  variable doesn't contain a path to a binary file on that device,
  boot manager should look for the default file, /EFI/BOOT/bootaa64.efi.

  Currently this feature is not implemented by boot manager, but
  some how managed by distro_bootcmd script.
  This situation has raised some concern/confusion in the discussion
  about Simon's bootflow idea.
