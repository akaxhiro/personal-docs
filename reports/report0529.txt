# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure

- No updates on Bugzilla[4].
  The guy from Intel told me that his assignment has been replaced with

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot v7[5]
  No comments to my patches against Coverity errors[6].

- "intermediate certificates" issue
  I haven't seen any comment to my patch (RFC) for sbsigntools[7].

  I have continued to rework the code to enable intermediate
  certificates in a signature and now believe that I've done.

  The change was split into two parts, one as preparatory patch
  including some bug fixes, the other for intermediate certificates
  support. That way, I believe, the second patch set could be
  shrunk and now got much simpler for easier understanding.

  The first patch set was posted today[8], and second will be
  posted sometime in the next week.
