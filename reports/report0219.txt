[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[3] (backend server) on zephyr.

  Since the prototyping was finished and the code can now compile without
  critical errors, I started debugging.
  I confirmed that Zephyr, as BE bare-metal application, starts
  and successfully talks to Xen via hypercalls and to Xenstore (daemon)
  via Xen API's. The code goes into the main loop, waiting for FE booting up
  and then hangs up when I start FE (also Zephyr) on another domain.

  So far, I'm rather optimistic about the progress of debugging efforts,
  but I want to find out a better way of tracing as I probably need to
  keep track of the code execution at FE, BE and Xen in parallel.

- Apart from technical challenges, there is one big issue in my approach.
  When Maarten (WindRiver) read my slides that I prepared for last Tuesday's
  meeting, he pointed out a license problem on my code.

  In order to make the prototyping easier in developing FE and BE application,
  a lot of code was derived from Linux, Xen and kvmtool. All of them are
  distributed under GPLv2, while Zephyr is under Apache 2.

  Those two licenses are thought to be incompatible[4] each other,
  in particular, regarding how the patents should be treated.
  While Apache 2 has a kind of 'patent termination' term, GPLv2 doesn't
  have any explicit statement.
  So merging GPLv2 code into Zephyr would lead to license infringement.

  Given that my current code is treated as a private prototype, and it would
  not be a problem, but it is inevitably impossible to make the code public
  in any form.
  The goal/output in my activity here must be set out differently
  (at least in short-term).

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress

- IOREQ on Arm[5] by EPAM
  The patch has now been merged in the upstream.

- Zephyr on Xen[6]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
