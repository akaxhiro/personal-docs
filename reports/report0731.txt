# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables

  Closed this card.
  Actually, we can also close DB-24 (Implement cache for runtime uefi
  variables) but it is currently assigned to Sughosh.

# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic

- "intermediate certificates" support[3]
  Most of all commits from this patch set have been merged in v2020-10-rc1,
  There is still one commit yet to be ack'ed.
  (But I don't see any issue on it.)

- Updated a travis patch to v2[4]

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v4[5].
  All the comments from Heinrich are trivial, but yet I will have to
  re-spin the code. As is often the case, he got silent after I commented
  back, and I don't know if he has agreed with my replies or not.

  'DFU' related changes must be reviewed/ack'ed by another maintainer,
  but he is on vacation.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)

- UHS2 support v3[6]
  I saw infrequent conversations in ML.

- I will have to think of writing a blog article about UEFI
secure boot.
