Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* Alex added STR-73 and STR-75 to "Sprint 1".

* latest result of latency measurement
  Added the result in (f) case

  a.user (+ nat): failed
  b.tap + bridge: OK
  c.macvtap: OK
  d.NIC passthrough: under investigation
  e.OpenVSwitch (as a simple bridge): not tried yet
  f.eBPF-based bridge: OK

  (netperf)
  $ netperf -H 192.168.20.1  -l -1000 -t TCP_RR -w 10ms -b 1 -v 2 -- \
      -O min_latency,mean_latency,max_latency,stddev_latency,transaction_rate

                         min    avg    max    stddev
  host2-to-host1         180    203    408    8.5
  vm-to-host1
    tap                  214    254    581    14.2
    macvtap              217    244    567    13.0
    eBPF (XDP)           221    254    571    13.4

[STR-73] (Setup for passthrough NIC)
* (insights I reported last week)
  - SoC supports IO virtualization (IOMMU) for NICs and PCIe bus
  - SoC can host a SR-IOV PCIe endpoint
  - NIC interfaces can be assigned to 9 VM's
    (which means Virtual Function/VF?, but NIC's are not on PCIe bus.)
  - To properly set up IOMMUs for NIC (and PCIe), some code for assigning stream IDs
    to the devices must be added to TF-A platform code.
  - Marvell engineer did basic tests against NIC and said that pass-through should work, but
  - He no longer has any enabling code

* I think that it will be more difficult to add VF support to NIC (mvpp2) driver
  as it would require more lines of code to implement it. So,

* After discussing with Alex, I'm now asking Marvell guys about whether the current PCIe
  driver can support SR-IOV for (NIC) devices on PCIe bus without any changes.

[STR-75] (Set up for eBPF-based bridge)
* The program is based on David's work[1].

* I finally succeeded in running netperf under this configuration.
  To make the network (UDP/TCP) work correctly, I had to turn off *hardware checksum
  offload" on guest's network interface with
    $ ethtool --offload enp0s1 rx off tx off
  (probably, "tx off" is mandatory.)

  I'm afraid that this restriction might impose negative impacts on network performance
  under heavy traffic with large data.
  Though I have seen little difference in values in the table above as the test environment
  is quite simple.

* FYI, I said last week that I heavily used 'ftrace' for debugging.
  But there is also some limitation (not a drawback); with ftrace, any inline function won't
  be traced while lots of functions in network stack are declared inline.
  So I had to rebuild the kernel from Debian source with debug printings in order to reach
  the last mile of the root cause :)

[STR-74] Setup for Open vSwitch
* No progress
  But from my experimental trial in February, it won't be difficult to set up Open vSwitch
  for evaluation purpose.

[STR-76] Break down the latency

* No progress

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration v3[2]
  The discussion on Simon's patch[3] has been somehow stalled for a while.
  I'm not sure whether my patch will eventually go into v2022.04 release
  at this moment.

(MISC)
* I reviewed or am still reviewing
  - Heinrich's short-form path support
  - Kojima-san's bootmenu v4[3]
    It contains (part of) my removable media patch[4].
    So I hope that I won't have to push this patch for being upstreamed.
  - Sughosh's capsule cleanup[5]

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress
