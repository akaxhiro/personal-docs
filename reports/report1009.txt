  Pinged Sughosh. He said that he needed another two weeks to
  prepare his new version.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  fixed several build errors and the patch[5] can now compile.
  Then I asked Ben to run (and debug) my code on his platform.

  So far, it seems that the driver fails to detect a UHS-2 interface.
  He said that data on a SD can still be accessible as a UHS-1.
  I can't do anything but just giving him some hints of debugging.

[LBI-40] / Stratos (?)
  I started with installing xen + dom0 on qemu as I have to learn much
  about xen and virtualization.

  First, I tried debian 10 + its xen packages, but it doesn't boot.
  After looking into issues that I found, I'm almost certain
  that the official xen packages have never been tested by debian team.
  (Presumably it hints that xen is no longer a favorite/popular target
  in the communities.)

  With bunch of tries and errors, I finally confirmed that the following
  combination of software successfully boots up the kernel:
        debian 11(testing) + upstream xen4.14.

  I'm now trying to build xen tools, which will be required in order
  to install domU as well as configure dom0, natively on qemu because
  I cannot find out any easy way to cross-build them.
