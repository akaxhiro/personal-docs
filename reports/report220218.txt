Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to set up MACCHIATOBin boards.
  Finally I got two boards from a local distributor.
  I was able to boot the linux kernel (latest v5.16) on the board,
  but the networking doesn't work. All the NIC devices on board are
  detected but the PHYs seem not to be properly initialized.

  FYI, the board has a cooling FAN for the SOC chip and it's quite noisy
  and hardly bearable :)

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration
  I submitted v2[2].
  V2 also breaks some existing tests (not linked to UEFI).
  One of errors was due to a "INFO-level" log message generated
  by my patch. It is easy to fix but I think that the assertion
  in that test is quite fragile because the test result (decision
  of success or failure) can be affected by a log message on
  the console.

  Another error seems not to be directly attributed to my patch.
  In one of my patch set, four new DM-related tests are added, but
  simply adding another test, whatever the test is, will cause
  a failure in one of existing tests.

  I reported this issue to ML and (I hope) Simon now takes care of it.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp (capsule authentication)[3]
  v11 has now been merged to the upstream.

  Heinrich also requested me to post a follow-up patch which enables
  capsule authentication tests to be kicked off in CI loop.
  But it is somehow intentional because Heinrich or Simon has opposed
  adding additional defconfig file just to run my pytest.

(MISC)
* reviewed some patches
  - Ilias' bugfix on secure boot authentication algorithm
  - Sughosh's "FWU Multi Bbank update" v4.
  - Masami's fixup relating to a reset by CapsuleUpdate

* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
