Orko
====
[ORKO-27] (Run performance benchmarks across testing matrix)
* This task has been put into "blocked" state due to hardware unavailability.

* Finally Anmar asked Shimada-san to get a GPU card for me.
  No detailed status of the purchase.
  No confirmation yet about the platform. Anmar suggested Synquacer or
  AVA, but I don't believe that Synquacer is a choice for GPU reference
  because it has a bug in 32-bit read operation on PCIe bus.
  (A bunch of nasty hacks, which are NOT upstreamable, will be required
  on a graphic driver, yet not sure if it is successful.)

* Collaboration with other activities?
  No progress seen

* Nvidia's new graphic driver (535.54.3)
  I have not tried it as it has not appeared as an Ubuntu package yet.

* Other issues with my v3 environment
  (no progress)
  I had no time to dig into those issues yet.
  - "-display gtk" doesn't work
    (This happens with v4.)
  - [vertex] device-local=true: Failed with exception: Failed to perform atomic commit: Invalid argument
  - vkmark: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so: \
            undefined symbol: wlEglCreateSurfaceExport

[ETC]
* I asked Alex to think of giving me other tasks in Orko that I can help
  as I have been idle for a while (and will be in near future).
  No feedback yet.

* pcivirtio-gpu error on crosvm with vritio-gpu enabled
  No progress


SCMI
====
[SCMI-47] (Add scmi base protocol support)
* After the discussion with Vincent, I will close this card after
  SCMI-58 and SCMI-74 which I have just created are finished.

[SCMI-46] (improve scmi suport on U-Boot)
* No sure who will be responsible for reviewing my patches[1],[2]
  as there is no dedicated maintainer for SCMI-related patch.

[2] https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2023-June/520083.html

[SCMI-58] (Add base protocol test)
* Finished and passed all the tests (assertions).
  I closed this card.

[SCMI-74) (Upstream patch of scmi base protocol support)
* Started to prepare for the patch submission
  This will include
  - clean-up (checkpatch and correcting spells)
  - add/revise commit messages
  - add function/struct descriptions to *every* function/struct
  - add a test against the command, scmi
  - add man-page of scmi command
    (although the command is for debug purpose.)

[SCMI-49] (Add pinctrl protocol support)
* Not yet started.


U-Boot support
==============
* None
