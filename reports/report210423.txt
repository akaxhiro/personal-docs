[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- Continued to investigate *my* backend code.
  The purpose is to study the possibility of isolating Xen-specific code
  from the rest of generic code.

  I have no visible progress here, instead I started to talk to
  Jan (Siemens, the Jailhouse maintainer).

  I think that the one of reasons that we see no comments on
  our proposal for SCMI demo is that nobody has any experience
  in implementing virtio backend (or frontend) and that
  they don't have good understandings of technical issues.

  On the other hand, Jan is of course an expert of Jailhouse,
  but also has a lot of experiences with automotive and industrial
  segments. We could expect valuable inputs from him.

- license terms of Xen libraries/toolstack
  I didn't attend Xen's FuSa community call on Thursday although
  Stefano invited me as well as Alex.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update
  Since I have had few feedbacks about virtio demo in Stratos ML,
  I spent my spare time in working on capsule update, in particular,
  capsule authentication implemented by Sughosh.

  When Sughosh's patches were merged, I didn't go through them
  in details. This week I had some discussion with our LT
  (Masami), and I found there are a couple of "non-good"
  implementations.

  In particular,
  1) The script in EDK2 is used to sign and generate a capsule file.
     Why do we want to use EDK2 source? Why not extend my mkeficapsule
     command?
  2) He added a wired device-tree overlay code to mkeficapsule.
     It has nothing to do with a capsule file, and the same processing
     can be performed by using the standard commands (dtc/fdtdelay.)

  So I decided to enhance mkeficapsule by adding a signing feature,
  and posted RFC[1] (but wo actual code), aiming to revise the current
  implementation.

  As some cleanup work is needed, I plan to submit the patch
  some time in the next week.
