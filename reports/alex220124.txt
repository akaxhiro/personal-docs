* network latency measurements
  - experimentally trying network confguration on my desktop PC:
      
#      1.ip-fowarding/NAT
#      2.tap+bridge
#        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
#      3.macvtap
#        ip link add link eth0 name macvtap0 address 52:54:00:b8:9c:58 \
#		type macvtap mode bridge
#	qemu ... -netdev tap,id=net0,fd=3 ... 3<> /dev/tap12

      4.open vSwitch (w/ or wo AF_XDP)
      5.XDP as a simple bridge
	-> don't want to run it on my PC

      * Please make sure this is XDP not AF_XDP
        (You and Mike sometimes suggested AF_XDP in test scenario/autmotive
	 demo, but I don't know what he meant by AF_XDP.)

  - a small write-up for my trial
    Please review, especially XDP usage.

  - One of my concerns is the performance really depends on
    network requirements/configuration.

      * macvtap, except a simple XDP, can perform best in a simple case.
	It, however, has some restrictions. 

  - Next
    Investigate tools for measuring *latency*

    Do we need to analyse details of overheads?
    You mentioned, in your "initial thoughts", xdp_xmit/xdp_redir/xdp_pass,
    saying,
	"For each experiment we need to measure the latency of 3 different
	 packet reflectors."
