[STR-7]/[STR-21]
- completed debugging the code for step-2 work
  Now my prototype app is up and running with the save behavior.
  No question that the FE app is the exact same as the step-1.

- started to update/refine the proposal document of virtio proxy approach.

- While I will be waiting for more feedback on my code and document,
  I will put my development work on hold next week and instead,
  I'm going to spend my time on learning Rust by myself
  as I was not granted a chance of joining Rust tutorial seminar. 

- Among others, there may be, at least, three technical issues in step-3:
  * it is totally unknown that my approach, particularly virtio proxy
    protocol (RPC), is applicable to other hypervisors than Xen.
  * Some of Xen's IOREQ-related API's, so Xen itself, must be modified.
  * Open-AMP is used as virtio library on frontend side, while
    kvmtools-origin library is used on backend side in my prototype.
    This means that the two interface might conflict when
    the frontend code and the backend code are integrated in virtio
    proxy implementation which has both aspects.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* Had a small talk with Ilias about my current capsule implementation.
* signing feature to mkeficapsule[1]
  no progress as I focused on virtio work this week.

=== Patch status ===
    uboot/cap auth v1: submitted on 05/12
    uboot/cap misc: submitted on 05/11
    kernel/uhs2  v3.1: submitted on 11/06
    uboot/sbsa    rfc: submitted on 11/04
    uboot/xen-earlyuart v1: submitted on 10/15

=== Issues ===
* So a big question here is whether my approach can be applied/deployed
  to other hypervisors (to meet the goal of STR-7)?
  Who will be able to take care of it at this point?
        -> Alex, Vincent

  (Actually, I have not got any feedback on this question.)
