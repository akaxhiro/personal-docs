agenda:
- Virtio-proxy work
  estimated efforts: 20-22 weeks ,including
		rewriting (part of) Xen libs (1-3w)
		modifying Xen hypercall interaces (4w)

  If efforts are not justified, what's next for me to do?

- Any topics from last Stratos Call?
  - permissive license on Xen libs (libxl)
  - rest-vmm (I didn't see any update)
