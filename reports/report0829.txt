[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v5[2].
  Pinged the DFU maintainer again but no response.
  (I'm sure that he is back from his vacation now.)

- Heinrich's DFU patch was reverted[3]
  My changes on DFU in [2] has some dependency and, strictly speaking,
  must be respined. But they can be reviewed in the current form
  as the essence is not affected.

- Sughosh started the discussion about capsule authentication[4]
  in boot-arch ML.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[5]
  I also saw comments from Adrian, mostly on sdhci controller side.
  At the first glance, they seem to be rather trivial.

  I haven't taken any actions so far.

(Misc)
- Blog write-up on UEFI secure boot
  I spent most of my time in writing an outline and draft version of
  article, but it looks to be an user/installation guide, with a series
  of commands, rather than a blog reading.

  So I'm thinking of how it should be revised.
