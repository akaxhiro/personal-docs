[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[1]
  After the discussion with Ulf and Masami, I pushed my latest patch
  to my linaro repo[2].
  (though I haven't touched the code in the last two months.)

  I also pinged Ben again, but haven't seen any response yet.

[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[3] (backend server) on zephyr.

  >  1.implement hypercall routines (based on linux, done)
  >  2.import 'event channel' and 'xenbus (or xenstore)' interfaces 
  >    (drivers) from mini-os/unikraft tree. (done)
  >  3.fix any compiling problems in Xen libraries
  >    (this may require additional code to be developed.)

  As I said last week, I made some changes on virtio-disk. The purposes
  were:
  * isolate xenstore-related code, which is quite Xen-specific, from others.
  * replace socket-based code in the main loop with Xen's API's.

  The resulting code yet heavily relies on Xen's API, but I believe that
  it will be easier to port virtio-disk onto Zephyr.

  Since there are still missing functions in event channel and xenstore
  interfaces imported from unikraft, (2) above, I will have to add
  some code to fill the gap.
  (I hope I will finished implementing 'buildable' code this week.)

- 'hypervisor-agnostic' backends
  I have looked into vhost-user (and rust-vmm) more closely. One of insights
  was that vhost-user library receives a file descriptor which represents 
  the portion of frontend's memory from kvm and map it on backend's address
  space with mmap().
  So it would be difficult to directly implement this protocol on Zephyr
  any way.

- Alex forwarded to me the invitation of the meeting, "Hypervisor-less virtio
  - with Zephyr?".

  I can easily imagine that, if we assume that we will only support "static"
  configuration of virtual domains with virtio devices and that such
  configuration will be available, say via system DT, we will not need most of
  hypervisor-specific code in backend code.
  (because we don't have to monitor up/down of frontent domains and fetch
  virtio's configuration dynamically in a hypervisor-specific way.)

  There may be one difference between hypervisor and hypervisor-less cases:
  notification. On Xen, for example, the notification will be delivered
  by an event channel, but an interrupt for heypervisor-less RTOS?

- GIC-related issues on Zephyr
  No progress.

- IOREQ on Arm[4] by EPAM
  v4 is now under review in ML

- Zephyr on Xen[5]
  No progress

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress
