[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  Continued to work on v4
  Finished to make changes, in particular, on "modularising" sdhci
  UHS-2 support and now trying to make it compile.

  But I'm now 100% sure that it won't work any more without substantial
  debugging efforts due to extensive refactoring.
