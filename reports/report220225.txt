Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to set up MACCHIATOBin boards.
  I was tackling two issues:
    - network doesn't work at U-Boot
    - failed to boot the system (TF-A & U-Boot) neither from SD or eMMC
    - (and FAN is too noisy :)

  And I think I have finally fixed both.
  As for networking, I had to set "ethprime" variable to "eth2" to enable
  1Gb ethernet interface. I'm still unsure whether 10Gb interfaces are
  up and running on Linux as the two interfaces on two boards are set to
  be directly connected each other (i.e. cross-linking) for measurement.

  As for boot failure, I made an trivial mistake in creating a boot media; 
  the first sector in a device, which is a partition table, must be
  skipped when copying a binary image :)

  Now that I am able to boot debian image from SD, I'm going to install
  debian file system on eMMC for regular (and measurement) use.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration v2[2]
  I did "bisect" my patch set and found that an error came out at
  Simon's "event notification" patch, in particular at an invocation
  of memcpy(). But I don't know yet why it results in a failure
  in running UT (U-Boot's unit test).

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp (capsule authentication) v11[3]
  no progress on a follow-up patch (for enabling capsule authentication
  test on sandbox)

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
