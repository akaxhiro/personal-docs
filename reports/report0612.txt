# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  No progress seen in ML.
  He said that the first priority for him was to merge Ilias'
  UEFI variable patch first.

- Secure boot v7[5]
  No comments to my patches against Coverity errors[6].

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update
# No updates since last week.

- v1 of capsule update patch[10]
  I reworked the code as a counter proposal against Sughosh's FMP
  (for qemu) draft patch. I believe that it includes a functionality
  that Sughosh tried to provide and yet will meet Heinrich's expectation
  of a generic (platform-agnostic) FMP driver.
  We will continue to discuss some issues next week.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [11]

- I've received some status update from Ben
  He is now working on the issue (1) (making sdhci-uhs2.c
  (a host driver) a module), but the progress seems to be quite slow.

  So I requested him to split his efforts into more smaller tasks
  and to set out work item candidates that we will share.
