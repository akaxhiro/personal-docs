Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* continued to learn basic network technologies, including
  TSN, XDP and SR-IOV (for virtual network).

  In particular,
  - more details of TSN protocols, and asked Kojima-san about
    his task on measuring a latency with TSN on DeveloperBox
  - PCI passthrough and SR-IOV(VF)
    If PF or VF under passthrough is available, it will be trivial
    that those technologies will give a vm the best network performance.

    Then I wonder why we will have to assess/investigate the software
    overhead in other cases (using XDP).
    (If a latency is a *must* requirement, it would be worth paying
    to have a dedicated NIC in automotive products. Using TSN or not
    is an independent issue.)

* continued to investigate the kernel's timestamping[1] on socket interface.
  It will give us some timestamping points in the kernel (either by
  software or hardware);
  1.sender side: "when data leaves the kernel. ...  generated in
    the device driver as close as possible"
  2."tx timestamps prior to entering the packet scheduler"
  3.receiver side: "just after a device driver hands a packet to the
    kernel receive stack"

  So, according to [1],
  (2) - (userspace timestamp) = protocol processing overhead
  (1) - (2) = driver (queing) delay

  I don't know yet what the timing of (3) is.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress
  Alex suggested that he didn't have an issue with the latest software.

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress
  Jean suggested that trampoline support wouldn't be needed by XDP.

[STR-66]
* hypervisor-less virtio
* virtio-over-argo
  no progress

 Francois may be interested in virtio-net.

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration, RFCv2[2]
  Simon gave me his ack's to two thirds of my patches.
  This only thing he asked me to do is to add a test for new features.

[TS-102]
- mkeficapsule revamp v7[3]
  I made a second ping to Heinrich and have received no comments. Sigh.  

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
  No progress
  This task somehow depends on the issue below.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress
  One of issues that Mark raised is how we should handle *pci bridges*
  between the root complex and end points.
