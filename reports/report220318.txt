[STR-73] (Setup for passthrough NIC)
* I contacted guys from semihalf.com who are the authors of the patch which enables
  IOMMU on Linux and guys from Marvell who are the authors of the patch which adds
  init code for IOMMU on TF-A.

  Based on the information I've got from them as well as HW specification document,
  - SoC supports IO virtualization (IOMMU) for NICs and PCIe bus
  - SoC can host a SR-IOV PCIe endpoint
  - NIC interfaces can be assigned to 9 VM's
    (which means Virtual Function/VF?, but NIC's are not on PCIe bus.)
  - To properly set up IOMMUs for NIC (and PCIe), some code for assigning stream IDs
    to the devices must be added to TF-A platform code.
  - Marvell engineer did basic tests against NIC and said that pass-through should work, but
  - He no longer has any enabling code

  So the issue is software, in particular, TF-A code (and linux driver as well?).
  With little knowledge about HW and basic VFIO framework, I have a big question mark here
  about how easy or difficult it is to implement the feature on MACCHIATOBin.

  For other devices like SATA and USB's, it looks quite easy to assign stream IDs
  but network devices seem to be more complicated due to VF support.

[STR-75] (Set up for eBPF-based bridge)
* The program is based on David's work[1].

* The network doesn't work yet.
  Now ping packets (ICMP) pass in both directions, but UDP (and hence TCP) packets
  passes from a remote host (not a local machine which hosts a guest vm) to a guest,
  but not from a guest to a host.

  What I have found so far is that UDP packets reach to the remote NIC interface,
  but the kernel stack drops them, *probably*, due to a bad checksum in IP.
  I don't know yet why the checksum is broken.

* FYI, I heavily use 'ftrace' (function graph tracer) to investigate/keep track of
  packet handling in the kernel stack as I am quite familiar with ftrace as the author of
  ftrace support for arm64. The old work helps myself now :)

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration v3[2]
  Simon posted a collection of small patches[3] that will help reduce
  the binary size for some platforms.
  The discussion is still ongoing.

(MISC)
* "removable media" support on UEFI bootmanager RFC[4].
  Konjima-san told me that he wanted to include (part of) my patch in his patch set
  that is an attempt to add "bootmenu" UI. So I gave him some comments.

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[5]
  No progress

* reviewed Kojiima-san's bootmenu RPC[6].
