Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* Attempted OVS with AF_XDP.
  (somehow strangely), we need to enable DPDK as well to enable AF_XDP
  support on OVS.
  Although I successfully built OVS (the latest, 3.0.1) and set it up on
  MacchiatoBin with seeing any error, the network didn't work.
  (Even ping didn't pass.)
  I will keep investigating the issue.

* No update on the result. See [1].

  TODO: find out a generic configuration of bridge to fix multicast issue
  (although this won't have any impact on measured results).

  TODO: With my own benchmark program, I sometimes see that read/readmsg()
  after select() fails.

U-Boot support
==============
No progress

[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[3]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[4]
  No progress (This topic might be related to UEFI-DM integration).
