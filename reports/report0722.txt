# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich posted v4[1] and it was merged in 2020-10-rc1.
  So this card can be closed.

# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic

- "intermediate certificates" support
  I submitted the patch v5[3] and related patches[4][5].
  Most work was on test scripts.
  While I believe that there are few issues remained, but I'm not sure
  because Heinrich can unexpectedly make comments even after he said
  that it (the code) looked good.

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- I submitted the patch v4[6].
  Most work was on test scripts.
  While I believe that there are few issues remained, but I'm not sure
  because Heinrich has not left any comments on the main logic.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)

- UHS2 support v3[7]
  Ulf left a few comments on the first two commits, kicking up
  slow discussions.

(Misc)
- I will have to think of writing a blog article about UEFI
secure boot.
