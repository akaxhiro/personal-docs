[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1],[2]

  Alex replied, saying that we could not justify the efforts of completing
  this task. So what's next that I can do?
  We will discuss in next 1:1 meeting.

[TS-118]
- UEFI-DM(U-Boot's driver model) integration[3]
  We continued the discussions, particularly on how we should
  model software partitions in DM world.

  Simon and Heinrich suggested that we had a special node (device)
  of 'partition table' in DM tree. But I don't think it is very
  useful as there is always 1:1 relationship between a physical device
  and a partition table and even the latter is not a 'device'.

  We still have some gap before reaching some consensus.

(MISC)
- U-Boot support
* mkeficapsule
  I submitted v5[4] and got some feedback from Simon, but his comments
  won't be big issues.
