Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* I and Vincent agreed that we'd better finish, at least hold off, this task
  for now unless we see any feedback from member companies or interested parties
  in the industry.

  I will talk to Alex in the next sync-up.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Probably we should close this card now.

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[1]
* I finished the draft of the 2nd article[2], addressing all the comments from Ebba.
  She said that she had already published the article but that it seemed not to have
  appeared on the web.
  We are waiting for an action by IT service.

[virtio-gpu]
* I'm by far unfamiliar with virtio-gpu and related technologies, so
  doing zapping among different sources to understand the architecture
  and the current circumstances around relevant software stack,
  including Vulkan driver for virtio-gpu (Vinus) in Mesa project.

* Reviewed and made comments on Alex's initial draft for [LBO-318].
  I would expect more concrete descriptions about objectives, deliverables,
  exit criteria and the strategy to the future step aiming to involve
  the community.
  Otherwise, the item (performance measurement) sounds to be an internal
  self-satisfying experiment (like my TSN work).

--- 5/15 ---
practical concerns:
* test platform
* software stability & version coflicts among the stack (on host & guest)

  -> Without any expertise, highly possible to get into trouble.

     A better way is to contact Collabora, AMD or Google and
     mimic their test environment.
     A more better way is to ask those folks to take measurements.

* benchmark programs (I tried them on x86+GTX1050/ubunt 22.04)
  - glmark2 (ran to finish)
  - vkmark  (failed with "invalid argument")
  - GFXBench (probably will run)
  - Basemark GPU (ran to finish)
* metric combination - no direct way to compare GL vs. VK

U-Boot support
==============
[SCMI on U-Boot]
  I'm asking Vincent to write up the EPIC card for this activity.
  Otherwise, the task seems to be very much ad-hoc.

* Preliminary study
  - Read SCMI specification.
  - Looked at the U-Boot code around pinctrl/gpio framework.
  - Reviewed the RFC patch from EPAM for adding scmi-pinctrl support to Linux.

* Test environment
  I'm trying to create the test environment using qemu with OPTEE/SCMI server.

  I think I successfully built all the necessary binaries, but got an error
  message like:
          WARNING: Image id=4 size out of bounds
          ERROR:   BL2: Failed to load image id 4 (-27)

* Prototyping[3]
  No progress
