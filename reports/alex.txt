- purpose of 1:1 sync
  - sharing "my" status
  - Alex's status
    how much of your time you can spend for virtio stuff?
  - circumstances around the project/related topics
    worried about the future of project
  - I'm shamful when posting any comments for premature topics
    as they go through virtio-dev ML
    Mike doesn't want to share his own opinion.
- who is the driving force of the project?
  pivotal person?
  collaborate with Francois/Joachim
  demos for artifacts
  daily activities/monitoring
  struggling to find out the direction yet
  big picture/ultimate goal
  visible/workable timeframe of development
- My propsal describes the techincal details of implementation,
  but not decision discipline behind the design/issues to tackle/
  constraints.
  Without those backgrounds, it could be difficult to discuss details.
- reinforce reasons for the design that I take here

- few comments from others in community/ML discussions
  - summer break or not
  - symathetic with hesitance of reviewing or getting involved in BE
- concept of hypervisor-agnostic
  - more discussions on high-level abstract/architectural aspects,
    or requirements/practical uses
  - Mike has concern on "my" approach
  - Mike promised to contact the key persons in Google/Qualcomm
  - SCMI can be a good example?
  - needs for RTOS support as BE targets, HLOS vs. minimal RTOS
- survey of commercial hypervisors' approach
- performance issues
- memory sharing; ivshmem, fat virtqueue


DPDK
- DPDK can be run/portable on RTOS? (under limited set of OS services)
  not sure can benefit best on linux (or HLOS)
- it is not ideal/suitable/preferable to put lot of application(device)
specific logic into the kernel/hypervisors.

vhost-user
- socket, eventfd(irqfd, ioeventfd), mmap with fd
- virtio-proxy ~= qemu's vrtio-device-model
  - more abstracted messages than virtio-proxy's events which are bare MMIOs
  - socket <-> virtio-proxy's virtqueue
