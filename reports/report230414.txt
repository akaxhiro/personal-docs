Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* No progress

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)[1]
* I got a reply from Ebba on my draft[2].
  Anyhow the post will be made next week.

* Continued to improve the presentation slides[3] for Linaro Connect Talk.
  As I have repeatedly said that the result might vary from test to test, 
  I performed the tests for all the bridge types once again.
  Probably I will do once or twice again next week to confirm the errors
  among tests.

  One of major changes I'm trying to made is the description about result
  analysis. I felt it difficult to explain my findings simply from the table
  (See page 20 in [3]) and going to add more specific explanation from
  some different POVs,
  say:
  - app only vs. w/ netperf
  - kernel bridge vs. XDP bridge
  - OVS vs. OVS+AF_XDP
  I hope it will be more understandable for those who take a first look
  at my results. (See pages 22-26)

  I'm also trying to run ftrace again to examine big spikes and PTP disorders.
  At least, I want to address possible reasons, making clear that those problem are
  not linked to any specific bridge implementation, and that finding the root
  cause is beyond the scope of my current study.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
* SCMI on U-Boot[4]
  I asked Etienne about the reason why SCMI with a device tree (on U-Boot)
  doesn't allow *multiple* agents.
  The direct reason is the DT binding of SCMI node requires that the node name
  should be a constant, 'scmi'. But there seems to be no deep discussion about
  why this restriction was introduced in the past.

=== Patch status ===

=== Issues ===
* I still need a PCIE (intel x550 or 82576) card for SR-IOV testing.
