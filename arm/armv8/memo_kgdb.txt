Points of testing kgdb
----------------------

1. build/kernel configuration
- CONFIG_KGDB
- CONFIG_KGDB_KDB
x CONFIG_KGDB_LOW_LEVEL_TRAP (only on x86 & mips)
- CONFIG_KGDB_SERIAL_CONSOLE
? CONFIG_SERIAL_KGDB_NMI
- CONFIG_KGDB_TESTS
- CONFIG_KGDB_TESTS_BOOT_STRING
- CONFIG_KGDB_TESTS_ON_BOOT

  Build and boot the kernel.
  Functions are to be tested later in section 4).

2. kernel parameters
(cmdline)
- kgdboc
- kgdbwait
- ekgdboc (only on x86?)
- kgdbcon
? nokgdbroundup
x kgdbdbgp (only over EHCI usb port)
(sysfs)

  Functions are to be tested later in section 4).

2.1 On hikey
   $echo ttyAMA0 > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc


3. in-kernel test
- run at boot time with default setting(V1F100)
- run manually
	? N100
	- F100
	? S100
	? I100
- run concurrency tests as stated in drivers/misc/kgdbts.c


4. basic functions
- entering kgdb at early boot time
- entering kgdb via sysrq
- entering kgdb via kdb via sysrq

- operating with kgdb over tty
- operating with kgdb over ethernet
- sharing serial between console and kgdb
? entering kgdb via NMI

- setting breakpoints
- setting hw breakpoints
- setting data watchpoints (if supported?)
- single stepping
- showing/modifying registers
- backtracing (show call frames)
- dumping memory

- debugging the kernel
- debugging a module

- working sane in big endian
x working sane along with kprobes
