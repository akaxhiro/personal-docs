# Split UEFI variables from U-Boot environment variables
# Type: Epic
# Status: To Do

- Heinrich's patch[1] (my patches[2] and [3])
  No progress seen in ML.
  He said that the first priority for him was to merge Ilias'
  UEFI variable patch first.

  [2] runtime variable access via cache

# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot follow-up v2[5]
  I posted it last week.
  Heinrich said that he agreed with my patch, except how we should
  handle "multiple signatures" case. It seems that he misunderstands
  this feature, confusing it with "intermediate certificates" support.

  Anyhow, this patch series is now in Heinrich's v2020.10-uefi
  branch. I think that it should have been merged in v2020.07 though.

  I submitted several fixes against pylint warnings[6].

- "intermediate certificates" support
  I submitted v2[7].

  Heinrich said nothing, but this patch series is also in his
  v2020.10-uefi.

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update
# No updates since last week.

- capsule update patch
  I had intended to catch comments from Sughosh before I posted it to ML,
  but he said that he had been blocked by me and that I should post
  it to ML without giving me any comments.

  So I submitted v2[8]. No comments so far.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [10]

- No update from Ben
  I'm investigating Ben's patch as well as SNI's patch.

(Misc)
- I will have to think of writing a blog article about UEFI
secure boot.
