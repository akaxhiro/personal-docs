Apologies for missing last week's report.

[KWG-471]
# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- No updates on Bugzilla[1].
  Pinged one of assignees (ARM) again, but saw no response.

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic

- "intermediate certificates" support[2]
  Finally Heinrich agreed to merge the last patch in my patch set.
  Actually I have not made any change, but instead fixed a bug[3]
  of the existing signature verification code, which caused him
  to see a test failure in his local environment.

- fixed multiple signatures issue
  Heinrich has raised his concern about the semantics in handling
  multiple signatures case.
  I have been doubtful about the issue, but then confirmed
  that he was right as I observed how EDK2 behaved against
  the same scenario.
  I submitted a fix patch[4] with the test case updated.

  Anyhow, this shows how important it is for us to have
  some kind of compliant test suite for secure boot as I mentioned
  in KWG-471.
  Otherwise, different implementations may work in a slightly different
  way, and this can potentially lead to security attack vectors.

(Misc)
- Blog write-up
  I have started to collect some topics that I would deal with
  in the article.
  In particular, I'm now trying to boot distro linux with secure
  boot enabled in U-Boo on qemu-arm64. Saw a bunch of difficulties.

  It was so tricky to install EFI-enabled OS image to a disk; at first,
  installed the OS with EDK2, then started U-Boot, enrolling
  all signature database, PK, KEK and db with the certificate extracted
  from shimaa64.efi.
  I finally managed to boot Centos, but still fail in installing
  Ubuntu.

  For your curiosity, Centos image, specifically shimaa64.efi and
  grubaa64.efi, is signed, but not by Mcirosoft CA but by
  "Red Hat *Test* Certifying CA".
  More interestingly, the certificate contains a "period of valid
  signing time", but it is from 2012 to 2013.
  Meanwhile, the signing time in, for example, shimaa64.efi, is
  dated '2019'.

  This fact implies that, at least with CentOS, secure boot has never
  been used on arm64 platforms.

- I would also like to mention a current hot topic, "BootHole",
  in the article though it is not directly linked to secure boot.
