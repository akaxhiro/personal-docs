[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Looked into more details of virtio-pci specification and
  investigated pci and ivshmem support in Zephyr.
  Interestingly, ivshmem driver was added by Intel folk and
  it implies that virtio-ivshmem can potentially be implemented on Zephyr.

  Meanwhile, I have not received any response from Gunyah folk yet.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* my follow-up patches v2[2] was merged.

* Submitted mkeficapsule v3[3]
  In this patch set, I did lots of things:
  - add signing feature to mkeficapsule command
  - add "--guid" option to mkeficapsule (for arbitrary FMP driver)
  - add man page/update UEFI document
  - add pytest test cases for capsule authentication

  I managed to add and run pytest on sandbox by adding a customized
  U-Boot configuration otherwise there is no way of embedding a key
  in the binary at pytest setup time.

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[4]
  As there is no detailed description about changes, I don't know
  what changes he really made. The way how the patch set is organized
  looks odd any way.
