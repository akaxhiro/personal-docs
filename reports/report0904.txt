[KWG-471]
# Header: Create common test suite for image authentication in UEFI secure
boot
# Type: Epic

- No updates on Bugzilla[1].
  I raised this issue in the EBBR bi-weekly meeting as one of topics
  was "EBBR testing progress".

[KWG-464]
# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# No updates since last week.

[KWG-339]
# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- patch v5[2].
  No feedback from DFU maintainer. No progress.

- Sughosh started the discussion about capsule authentication[3]
  in boot-arch ML.
  The conclusion was we should not define how a key for authentication
  be handled in the specification because it is only an issue of firmware,
  it has nothing to do with "interfaces between firmware and OS".

(Misc)
- Blog write-up on UEFI secure boot
  I think I have finished 90-95% of writing[5], but want to have
  some time to refine some explanations and improve the overall story
  before asking for reviews.
