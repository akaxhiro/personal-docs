[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[1][2]
  Ulf finally submitted his change[3].

  At a first glance, I have no idea how big the impact is
  to the current patch, either core side or host side.

[STR-21]
- continued to work on porting/implementing 'virtio-disk'[4] (backend server) on zephyr.

  >  1.implement hypercall routines (based on linux, done)

  >    (drivers) from mini-os/unikraft tree. (done)

  Before debugging further, my current code was rebased to the upsteam
  branch (Xen and virtio-disk) in which IOREQ patch has already been merged.
  There were a couple of issues:
  * some patches, particularly ones to Xen libraries, have not yet
    been merged.
  * BE (IOREQ server in Xen jargon) can only be set on domO due to
    Xen's default security policy. The behavior seems to have been
    changed in later versions.
    (Obviously I'm trying to run BE Zephyr on a domU.)

  The app still fails in setting an IOREQ server,
  i.e. xendevicemodel_create_ioreq_server(), during the initialization.

  If this issue is fixed, the code will run into the main loop
  which will actually handle virtio queues.
  Hopefully, it will get up and running at some time during the next week.
