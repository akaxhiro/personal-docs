  on behalf of Lukasz.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3[4]
  Continued to work on v4, in particular, sdhci controller side.

  During refactoring the code, I found many redundant, inconsistent or
  ambiguous, and so dubious, code in UHS-II support.
  So while Adrian's comments are rather trivial at the first glance,
  it will take more time to morph and refactor the code.
  (and it was not so "straight-forward" to convert the code as a module
  as Adrian doesn't like my current approach.)
  I'm going to take a step-by-step approach by confirming one change
  at a time in ML.

- Ben occasionally replies to my comments on ML, but has not informed
  me of his current status.
