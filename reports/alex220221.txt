   CPU FAN is quite noisy.

   now 1G-ethernet is up and running, but neither 2.5G nor 10G.
   (1G as eth2, not eth0, Sigh.)

     => <UPDATE> now 10G's are up on pre-built image 4.4.52

  -For instance (on v5.16),
   ======
   # dhclient eth0
   cma_alloc: 30 callbacks suppressed                     
   cma: cma_alloc: reserved: alloc failed, req-size: 8 pages, ret: -12
   ...
   mvpp2 f2000000.ethernet eth0: PHY [f212a600.mdio-mii:00] driver [Generic Clause 45 PHY] (irq=POL)
   mvebu-comphy f2120000.phy: unsupported SMC call, try updating your firmware
   mvebu-comphy f2120000.phy: Firmware could not configure PHY 4 with mode 15 (ret: -95), trying led
   mvpp2 f2000000.ethernet eth0: configuring for phy/10gbase-r link mode 
   cat: can't open '/etc/resolv.conf.*': No such file or directory        
   ======

  -If the two ports on two boards are connected each other with
   a (straight, maybe) cable, the LED turns *amber*.

   So I guess
   auto-detection of cable-type (aka. MDI-X?) is not supported and
   the phy doesn't have ability to switch signal lines autmomatically, or
   simply because the cable is CAT6?


  -For 10G, I found some disucssion in:
   http://macchiatobin.net/forums/topic/10g-interfaces-not-working/

   No solution found.
