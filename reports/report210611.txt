[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- Continued to debug the code for step-2 work
  I confirmed that the RPC implementation works and that the backend
  successfully starts the configuration phase. But I found some design
  flaws on the current RPC implementation:
     - Posix message queue (mqueue) had to be replaced with Zephyr's
       k_queue as I assumed that messages will be passed "by pointer"
       rather than "copying".
     - "Nested" RPC cannot be allowed. In most cases, that's fine, but
       there is one exceptional case;
          proxy --(mmio write to QUEUE_PFN register)-->
                        server --(vm op (map memory))-->
                                proxy --(return from vm op -->
                                          server

       So the message handling, at least on server side, must be
       asynchronous with receiving messages. Otherwise the server cannot
       accept a reply from vm op in the case above.

  Even with those issues, I am rather confident that the step-2 work
  (thread model) will prove up and running by the end of the next week.

  So a big question here is whether my approach can be applied/deployed
  to other hypervisors (to meet the goal of STR-7)?
  Who will be able to take care of it at this point?
        -> Alex, Vincent

- Among others, there may be, at least, three technical issues in step-3:
  * it is totally unknown that my approach, particularly virtio proxy
    protocol (RPC), is applicable to other hypervisors than Xen.
  * Some of Xen's IOREQ-related API's, so Xen itself, must be modified.
  * Open-AMP is used as virtio library on frontend side, while
    kvmtools-origin library is used on backend side in my prototype.
    This means that the two interface might conflict when
    the frontend code and the backend code are integrated in virtio
    proxy implementation which has both aspects.

(MISC)
- I've got some inquiries about kdump from Fathi.

- U-Boot capsule update support
* Add signing feature to mkeficapsule[1]
  no progress as I focused on virtio work this week.
