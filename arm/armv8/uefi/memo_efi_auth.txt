DxeImageVerificationHandler
---------------------------
* if not signed, use hash algo of sha256 for verification
	TODO: which part should be digested?
  - Signature in Dbx first
	DENIED
  - Signature in Db
	SUCCESS
  - if not found in both, should return FAILURE
    (No inforamtion is recorded in executable information table.)

* PE may have multiple signatures in every WindCert->dwLength
  (wCertType should be PKCS7_SIGNED_DATA), so iterate

  - hash PE (mImageDigest) based on digestAlgorithms of SignedData
    of authenticode
    (TODO: which is not decoded in the current pkcs7 parser.)
    (TODO: Data to be hashed is more complicated. See HashPeImage())

  - Is Forbidden By Dbx
    - verify signature with x509 certificates in "dbx"
      (CERT_X509 only)
    - If not rejected,
      - go through signer's certificates list, and
        check if their hashes are in "dbx"
        - retrieve TBSCertificate
        - calculate a hash
          (where hash algo is determined by signature type in "dbx")
	  (Algo should be one of CERT_X509_SHA256/SHA384/SHA512)
	- check if hash is in signature list
        - If found, this give us a revocation time,
      - If found,then check if sigining time in timestamp signature
        passed revocation time
      - If not found, continue

  - Is Allowed By Db
    - verify signature with x509 certificates in "db"
      (CERT_X509 only)
    - If verified, check if the used certificate is in "db"
      as in "IsForbiddenByDbx"
    - Then, check if signing time pass revocation time.

  - Db may allow or not allow, then double-check against mImageDigest
    (CertType should be one of CERT_SHA1/SHA256/SHA384/SHA512)
    - Is Signature Found in Dbx
        DENIED
    - Is Signature Found in Db
        SUCCESS

  - make a copy of signature(mImageDigest)
    (used for executable information table)

* Finally, if the image is rejected,
  add inforamtion in executable information table.
