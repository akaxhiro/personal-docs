Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* No update on results [1]

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* Continued to investigate a big latency observed  in a long-run (at most,
  1 minute though) measurement.
  My initial analysis of ftrace logs suggests that some block I/O activities on
  the guest VM, which lead to an "IO thread" being invoked, may have affected
  the scheduling of the kvm process (more strictly, vcpu thread in the process).

  So I tried a couple of different configurations:
  1) modify my benchmark program so that the log will be written out
     *after* the test is terminated
  2) use ext2 for the root file system. Please note ext4 supports
     "journaling" that may cause asynchronous I/O's.
  3) use tmpfs as the current directory when I run the benchmark program.
     For the same reason as (2).
  4) run the benchmark program when we are on initrd (by adding "break=init"
     at the kernel cmdline.)
     For the same reason as (2). This test case can potentially suppress some
     IO-related system activities (like some level of loggings?) as well.

* Unfortunately, however, I have not yet reached any conclusion about the root
  cause of big latencies.

  Basically, (1), (2) and (3) have made no distinct difference on the results
  (although the maximum latency can vary from trial to trial).

  Only in (4) case, I saw some improvements like:
  ---
  Total: 60000 packets (~= 1minute)
    latency min/avg/max/stddev (usec): 62.380/82.553/196.903/7.678
    delta min/avg/max/stdev (usec): 897.623/999.998/1123.950/12.047

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)
* No update after the first blog post[2].

 --- FYI ---
 The meeting with Continental will be held in the second (or third?) week
of January (according to Anmar).

U-Boot support
==============
No progress

[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[3]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[4]
  No progress (This topic might be related to UEFI-DM integration).
