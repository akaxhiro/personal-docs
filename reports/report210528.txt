[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- Continued step-2 work
  I finished the coding on vitio backend side, including basic
  rpc interfaces. The remaining to implement is the main loop
  on virtio proxy side.

  I hope that I will be able to start some sort of debugging
  by the end of the next week.

- One of concerns is that there's no guarantee that the interfaces
  between virtio proxy and the backend, in particular, vm services
  called by the backend to virtio proxy are so good *generic* as
  they can be applied to other hypervisors.
  The interfaces are direct derivatives from Xen API's: 

  struct vm_ops {
        int (*set_irq)(void *handle, int irq, int level);
        (void *)(*map_guest_range)(void *handle, uint64_t addr,
                                   uint64_t size);
        int (*unmap_guest_range)(void *handle, void *ptr,
                                 uint64_t size);
        int (*register_memory_space)(void *handle, uint64_t start,
                                     uint64_t size);
        int (*deregister_memory_space)(void *handle, uint64_t start);
  };

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* Add signing feature to mkeficapsule[1]
  no progress as I focused on virtio work this week.
