Subject: [Weekly] Week ending 2021-09-03
Reply-To: 

[STR-7]
- my proposal document on virtio-proxy[1]
  Waiting for any comments on ML[2], but nothing after four weeks.
  Mike said, "I think when Alex is back next week we start to form
  the next cycle plan, I know that Qualcomm is generating an opinion
  that I'd like to include in that first draft."

  But I don't anticipate QC will have a more concrete idea.

  So what can I do?

- Alex's RFC about hypervisor-agnostic backend[3].
  Some updates:
  1) Arm guy (Wei Chen) is also trying to build
     a hypervisor-agnostic BE (library?) based on kvm-tool[4].

  2) a proposal for kvm to add "MMIO/PIO dispatch" mechanism[5]
        -> The person work on this task during her "Outreachy internship".
           (I don't know what this internship is.) Then we can't see
           any progress any time soon. RedHat won't take over the task.

  3) Matias talks about his experience about his hypervisor-agnostic PoC
     (I don't know who he is and for which company he works.)
  New topics:
  4) Oleksandr(EPAM) is now proposing to add a new hypervisor interface[6]
     to Xen, which allows for creating the mapping of the whole FE memory
     space to BE at the beginning, then we will be able to eliminate 'mmap'
     operations at every virtio request handling.
  5) Christopher explained Argo framework on Xen, which is a hypervisor-
     agnostic inter-domain communication mechanism.
     He suggested that Argo can be used as another transport for virtio's
     and provides a hypervisor-agnostic BE solution.
     I looked into the design doc of virtio-over-Argo, but I don't know
     yet what is the current status.

- I'm still trying to contact some engineers:
  no progress

  Intel: who has proposed msi-x support for virtio-mmio at linux kernel
  a year ago, aiming to improve the performance under multiple virt queues.
  Another Intel guy: who implemented ivshmem driver on Zephyr. I'm asking
  about their future plan, especially virtio implementation on top of it.
  Siemens: keep discussions with Jan
  Qualcomm: I'm asking for any comments on my proposal

- Stratos internal review
  I made some comments, but no replies except from Mike.
  Why? Nobody is very much interested in the doc?

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update support
* posted mkeficapsule v3
  Since we see no or little progress on the discussion about where to save
  a public key in capsule authentication, I submitted v3[7] in which I dropped
  pytest-related patches as they reply on the result of discussion.

- Bootflow/bootmethod proposal on U-Boot
  Simon proposed some API's for managing the boot sequence/order[8],[9].
  Currently, the boot order can only be customized by a hush script.
  (So the script, distro_bootcmd, is quite complicated.)
  It appears that Simon also wants to kinda integrate UEFI boot manager
  into this framework and so it may have some impact on the future
  implementation of UEFI boot manager.
  I reviewed the patches and joined the discussions.

- MMC UHS-II support
* Genesys guy (Jason, yet another guy) posted v3.2[10]
  No discussions seen in ML

=== Travel&Holiday&Event ===
I will take one-week vacation at the beginning of September
(the week of Aug 30th or Sept 6th) unless the period of the state
of emergency in Tokyo will be extended after end of August.

But it is quite likely thanks to recent surge of covid cases.
