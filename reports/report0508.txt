- Secure boot v7[5]
  Follow-up patches[6] were accepted.

  errors in my past UEFI-related commits. I posted fix patches[7].

  No visible progress due to efforts on capsule patch

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- Submitted v1 of capsule update patch[7]
  Meanwhile, Sughosh sent out his v1 of qemu FMP driver[8].

  I had a meeting with Heinrich and discussed issues; He showed
  a couple of concerns, quote,
  1.when do we initialize the UEFI sub-system and do capsule updates
  2.how many different FMP implementation do we need and how this will
    be coordinated with Sughosh
  3.runtime variable support - Where should we head?

  He expected that I and Sughosh should collaborate more closely
  and find a solution for (2).

- Discussions about runtime variable access support in Boot-arch ML[9]
  No progress on ML, but in a meeting with Heinrich, we agreed
  that we should promote discussions.

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [10]

- Pinged Ben (the patch author).
  He said that he had to have postponed his patch submission as he had
  been busy on other tasks. He will talk to his boss about the priorities.

  I told him that I was willing to help him.
