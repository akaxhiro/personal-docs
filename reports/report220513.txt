[STR-73] (Setup for passthrough NIC)
* TODO: create sub cards for SR-IOV/TSN trial

* NIC card purchase
  I created a list of items to buy and Mike approved:
  1) Intel I225-IT * 2 sets
  2) Intel X550-AT2 * 1 or 2 sets, or
     82576-based NIC from any brand as a cheaper option (1Gb only)
  3) any brand SSD 256GB or bigger * 1 or 2 sets
     with SATA cables/power cables (and power supply)

  I'm waiting for Gen's reply/action.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* one-way trip time
  I created a very simple benchmark program to measure one-way trip time.
  It is so much simple as creating a socket, capturing timestamps
  at tx time and rx time and then calculating the gap.

  The result looks like [micro sec]:
	0: up -16446.210    (client -> server)
	0: down 16817.845   (server -> client)
	1: up -16533.982
	1: down 16746.242
	...

  Apparently, the system clocks on both sides are not yet synchronized
  although PTP daemon is working:
	ptp4l: [3328.418] master offset          5 s2 freq   -1754 path delay      2704

  FYI, NIC's clock is set to propagate to the system clock by:
  # phc2sys -a -r

* Continued to learn about VLAN/QoS configuration with linux's tc.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[1] was merged in v2022.07-rc2.
* Heinrich made some comments on the follow-up patch[2] before my vacation,
  and now I posted v2[3].
  It was a fully rewritten version because the feature to add here should
  be implemented by UEFI boot manager rather than by 'LoadImage' API.

(MISC)
* Device path creation improvement for USB device[4]
  No progress
