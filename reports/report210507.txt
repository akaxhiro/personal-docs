[STR-21] or rather [STR-7]?
- Continued to investigate *my* backend code.
  After the discussion with Vincent, I wrote up a draft document
  for generic virtio backend framework.

  I'm going to elaborate more details of specification in the document,
  or work on a prototype based on my current virtio backend on Xen.
  By doing them in parallel, I hope the one will give the other
  good feedback.

(MISC)
- U-Boot capsule update RFC[1]
  I have pinged a couple of times but not received any replies
  neither from Heinrich nor Sughosh.

- Also helped Masami to try capsule update on Developer Box.
