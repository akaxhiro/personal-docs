# Header: Upstream UEFI secure boot (stage 1)
# Type: Epic
# Status: In Progress

- Secure boot v7[5]
  Posted several follow-up patches[6] to address Heinrich's
  (minor) comments that he expressed *after* merging my patch.
  (Most of comments were on lines that I haven't touched for
  a long time since earlier versions.)

  Continued to work on fixing "intermediate certificates" issue.
  I had to import an extra file, pkcs7_verify.c, from linux code
  in order to avoid implementing the *correct* logic from the scratch.
  While some sort of customization was needed, I've almost finished
  the coding, and am now investigating how test environment should be
  properly set up.

  One of big issues is there is no tool available that would allow us
  to insert additional intermediate certificates required as a trust-chain
  when a image is signed.
  (Microsoft's "signtool.exe" does this, though.)

  Some document in EDK2 source describes how intermediate certificates
  can be created and how a "signature" file be generated by using
  openssl commands. But this tool doesn't have ability to create
  a signed UEFI (PE-format) binary, inserting Microsoft-compatible
  "authenticode" data to its header.

  So my test efforts will depend on whether I can find out a signing tool
  or not. (Please note that I don't have any Windows system at home.)

# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- RFC patch[7]
  Continued updating the code to prepare for v1.

  I talked to Sughosh, and his expectation is that getting my capsule
  patch upstreamed is a priority, over "intermediate certs" issue,
  as it will "unblock" his efforts of sending his new fmp driver patch
  as well as completing capsule authentication test.

  So I'm going to get back to this task temporarily and send out
  a new version any way early next week before my holidays.
  (The only left task is to complete tests against updated code.)

- Discussions about runtime variable access support in Boot-arch ML[8]
  Little progress on ML

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support) [9]

- As our engineer, who was once in charge of mmc driver, is now quite
  busy on another project, I don't expect that he will be able to
  collaborate with me before the end of May.
