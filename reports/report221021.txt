Stratos
=======
[STR-68] (network latency behaviour with VMs)
* TODO: investigate eBPF case
  I chatted with Leo and he suggested that kernel configurations,
  CONFIG_BPF_JIT_[ALWAYS|DEFAULT]_ON may have had impact on the performance
  of XDP case.
  My config contains CONFIG_BPF_JIT_DEFAULT_ON=y, but doesn't
  CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON. In addition, I confirmed that
  /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable was 1 on live system and so hopefully
  JIT was already activated, but I will have to examine whether or not
  CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON makes things different.

* No update on the result. See [1].

  TODO: find out a generic configuration of bridge to fix multicast issue
  (although this won't have any impact on measured results).

  TODO: With my own benchmark program, I sometimes see that read/readmsg()
  after select() fails.

[STR-76] Break down the latency
* I tried to test "taprio (full offload)" case with my new configuration,
  and got much better results than in the past experiment.

  With UDP_STREAM,
                         min    avg    max    stddev
  tap+bridge
     no netperf		 45.9	 53.6  126.9	5.7
     w 3 netperf's	 96.72  124.6  390.0   17.9

  The only difference in the configuration from what I used in the past
  was "irq tuning" on receiver side. It is a possibility that the past
  experiments suffered instability from the receiver side intervention.

  Once I've got confidence that the result of taprio (full offload) case is
  quite constant, I will switch back to taprio from mqprio in my future
  experiments.

* TODO: I don't know yet how we can remove arch-timer interrupts.
   NO_HZ?, but the benchmark program calls select/poll() to wait for
   incoming packets and so we will need a timer on guest VM.

[STR-41] (Implement SVC/HV passthrough for Xen on ARM64)
* No progress

[STR-66]
  No progress

[STR-70] (Check the status of eBPF for ARM64)
* No progress

[LBO-293] (Talk about the Stratos work on characterising the impact of VMs ...)
* I think that I have finished about 80 % of blog article and
  hopefully I will be able to hand off my initial draft to Alex and Vicent
  for their review early next week.

  Difficulties that I have had in drafting this write-up were:
  - good introduction (background) for my task
  - Despite mentioning TSN, my focus in latency evaluation doesn't rely on TSN.
  - Too simple test scenario; I intended but failed to deepen the discussion
    on more realistic system setup/latency requirements.
  - I noticed I misunderstood XDP case; The system should fully offload kernel
    stack into userspace by utilizing the comibnation of <DPDK or AF_XDP> and
    OVS

U-Boot support
==============
[TS-219]
* The follow-up patch[4]
  No progress. Although a patch for testing in the original patch series is yet
  to be merged, I think we can close this card.

(MISC)
* I submitted a small clean-up patch[5].

* Device path creation improvement for USB device[6]
  No progress (This topic might be related to UEFI-DM integration).
