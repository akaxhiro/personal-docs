# Header: UEFI Support implementation in U-Boot
# Type: Initiative
# Status: In Progress
# No updates since last week.

- Closed this Initiative card as all the child cards have been
  closed.

[LEDGE-187]
# Header: U-Boot capsule update

- v9[2]
  As I got additional comments, I will have to respin the code again.
  (Those comments should have come in earlier versions as I haven't
  changed any main logic in the last few versions.)

- capsule authentication
  Sughosh finally posted his patch[3].

[KWG-488] (mmc UHS-2 support)
- UHS2 support v3.1[4]
  I've got comments from Adrian.
  While I have not looked at them in details, he said, "Overall, I like
  this approach." Good sign for v4.

- Trial of Xen guest vm

  Continued working on implementing a virtio frontend driver (block
  device) on Zephyr using Open-AMP library. The base code for block
  device driver comes from Linux (drivers/block/virtio_blk.c).

  I think I finished the setup code for virtqueues.
  The only remaining part would be to put/get block IO requests
  via the queues. (Hopefully it will take another one or two days.)

- Continued to discuss about GIC-related issues on Zephyr with Stefano
  and Julien.
  Before sending out a bug fix against spurious interrupts, I will have
  to confirm the rules of submission in Zephyr community.
  (All the patches seem to go through github's pull requests.)
  I asked Kumar, but no response yet.

- Zephyr on Xen
  While I have my own prototype code of Xen support for Zephyr,
  some guy from EPAM has posted his patch set[5].
  (There seems be another update after that.)

  I made some comments, in particular, around the device tree definition/GIC.
  Since Zephyr uses its own bindings for device trees, they can be
  confusing/problematic.

- I attended Mike's presentation of stratos project at
  "Linaro Autumn 2020 (for Socionext)".

- Debugging ability for guest vm (or Xendbg)
  No progress

- DEBUG_UART, or U-Boot's earlyprintk, patch[6]
  No progress
